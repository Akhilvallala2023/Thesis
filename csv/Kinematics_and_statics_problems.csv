\textbf{Problem:}

A stone is dropped from a height of 19.6 m above the ground, while a second stone is simultaneously projected from the ground with sufficient velocity to enable it to ascend 19.6 m. Determine when and where the stones will meet.

\textbf{Solution:}

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( h_1 = 19.6 \, \text{m} \) be the initial height from which the first stone is dropped.
    \item \( v_0 \) be the initial velocity of the second stone projected upwards.
    \item \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) be the acceleration due to gravity.
    \item \( t \) be the time in seconds after the stones are released.
\end{itemize}

The position of the first stone as a function of time is given by:
\[
y_1(t) = h_1 - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

The position of the second stone as a function of time is given by:
\[
y_2(t) = v_0 t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

To find when and where the stones meet, set \( y_1(t) = y_2(t) \) and solve for \( t \).

A boy stands at a point $A$ in a field at a distance of $600 \, \text{m}$ from the road $BC$. In the field, he can walk at a speed of $1 \, \text{m/s}$, while on the road, he can walk at $2 \, \text{m/s}$. He can walk in the field along the path $AD$ and on the road along $DC$ to reach the destination $C$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:route}). 

What should be his route so that he can reach the destination in the least time? Determine the time taken.
