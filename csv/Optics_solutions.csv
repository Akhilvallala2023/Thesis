Let the point source be located at the centre \( O \) of a sphere of radius \( R \), located within the medium. Light proceeding within a cone of semi-angle equal to the critical angle \( C \) can alone escape from a plane surface on the top, as shown in Fig. 15.14.

\end{figure}

Consider a circular strip of radius \( r \) and width \( dr \), symmetric over the sphere’s surface. The angle \( \theta \) is measured with respect to the \( z \)-axis.

\[
\text{Area of the circular strip} = 2\pi r \, dr
\]

\[
\text{Surface area of the sphere} = 4\pi R^2
\]

The fraction \( df \) of the area of the strip to the area of the sphere is given by:

\[
df = \frac{\text{area of the strip}}{\text{area of the sphere}} = \frac{2\pi r \, dr}{4\pi R^2} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{(R \sin \theta)(R \, d\theta)}{R^2} = \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta \, d\theta
\]

The fraction of light escaping within the semi-angle \( \theta \) is then given by:

\[
f = \int df = \int_0^\theta \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta \, d\theta = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \cos \theta)
\]

Substituting \( \theta = C \), the critical angle, we have:

\[
\cos \theta = \cos C = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 C} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\mu^2}} = \frac{1}{\mu} \sqrt{\mu^2 - 1}
\]

Thus, the fraction \( f \) becomes:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{\mu} \sqrt{\mu^2 - 1} \right]
\]

The momentum carried by each photon is given by \(\frac{h\nu}{c}\). If it is incident normally on a black surface, it exerts an impulse of \(\frac{h\nu}{c}\). The total pressure exerted would be 

\[
\frac{1}{c} \sum h\nu
\]

where the summation extends over photons of all frequencies incident on the surface per unit area per second. If \(W\) is the power of the source, then at distance \(r\), the intensity \(I\) is given by

\[
I = \frac{W}{4\pi r^2}

Then the pressure \(P\) is

\[
P = \frac{I}{c} = \frac{W}{4\pi r^2 c}

Suppose a ray going from $A$ to $B$ traverses distances $s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots, s_p$ in media of indices $n_1, n_2, n_3, \ldots, n_p$, respectively. The total time of flight is then (Fig. 15.15):

\begin{equation}
t = \sum_{i=1}^{p} \frac{s_i}{\nu_i} = \frac{1}{c} \sum_{i=1}^{p} n_i s_i
\end{equation}

The last summation is known as the optical path length (O.P.L). Fermat’s principle states that a ray of light traverses from one point to another by a route which takes the least time. A more stringent formulation of Fermat’s principle is as follows: A ray of light, in traversing from one point to another, regardless of the media, adopts such a route which corresponds to a stationary value of the optical path length:

\begin{equation}
\text{O.P.L} = \int_{A}^{B} n(s) \, ds
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figure15_15.png} % Placeholder for Fig. 15.15
\end{center}

A function $f(x)$ is said to have a stationary value at $x = x_0$, if its derivative $\frac{df}{dx}$ vanishes at $x = x_0$. A stationary value could correspond to a maximum or minimum. Let a ray of light proceed from $A(0, y_1)$ in a medium of index $n_1$ and be incident at $C(x, 0)$ on the interface, get refracted, and reach $B(x_2, y_2)$ in the medium of index $n_2$:

\begin{equation}
\text{O.P.L.} = n_1(AC) + n_2(CB) = n_1 \sqrt{x^2 + y_1^2} + n_2 \sqrt{(x_2 - x)^2 + y_2^2}
\end{equation}

Taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it to zero for stationary value:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d(\text{O.P.L.})}{dx} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_1 \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y_1^2}} - n_2 \frac{x_2 - x}{\sqrt{(x_2 - x)^2 + y_2^2}} = 0
\end{equation}

This simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
n_1 \sin i - n_2 \sin r = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\sin i}{\sin r} = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \quad (\text{Snell's law})

\section*{Mirage: An Optical Illusion}

A mirage is a type of illusion formed by light rays coming from the low region of the sky in front of the observer. On a sunny day, a road gets heated, and a temperature gradient is established in the vertical direction with the upper air layer being slightly less warm, and the corresponding indices of refraction being slightly larger. As the rays penetrate the atmospheric depth, they start bending due to refraction, becoming horizontal to the road and then bending upwards. The blue of the sky in the background produces a virtual image of a water pool, and the turbulence of air close to the road enhances the effect of a water pool with waves on the surface. This phenomenon is known as a mirage.

    \label{fig:mirage}
\end{figure}

Referring to Fig. \ref{fig:mirage}, we can see how the temperature gradient causes the light rays to bend. As the road heats up, the air just above it becomes warmer and less dense, resulting in a lower refractive index. The light rays from the sky bend towards the denser, cooler air above, eventually reaching a point where they bend upwards, creating the illusion of a water pool on the road.

\section*{Optical Path Length}

The optical path length (O.P.L) is given by:

\[
\text{O.P.L} = \sum_{i=1}^{2} n_i s_i = n_1 AB + n_2 BC + n_1 CD
\]

This can be expressed as:

\[
\text{O.P.L} = n_1 \sqrt{\frac{(d-x)^2}{4} + h^2} + n_2 x + n_1 \sqrt{\frac{(d-x)^2}{4} + h^2}
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
\text{O.P.L} = n_2 x + n_1 \sqrt{(d-x)^2 + 4h^2} \tag{1}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Fermat's Principle}

According to Fermat's principle, the derivative of the optical path length with respect to \(x\) is zero:

\[
\frac{d(\text{O.P.L})}{dx} = 0
\]

Using equation (1), we have:

\[
n_2 - n_1 \frac{(d-x)}{\sqrt{(d-x)^2 + 4h^2}} = 0
\]

Substituting \(n_1 = 1.00030\), \(n_2 = 1.00020\), and \(h = 2 \, \text{m}\), and solving, we find:

\[
d-x = 282.8 \tag{2}
\]

Thus,

\[
x = 500 - 282.8 = 217.2 \, \text{m}
\]

\subsection*{(c) Observation}

From equation (2), it is observed that as \(d\) decreases, \(x\) also decreases. The smallest value for \(x\) is zero, in which case the distance of the observer from the tree would be \(d = 282.8 \, \text{m}\) when the mirage disappears.

\section*{15.5 (a) Purpose of Cladding}

The purpose of the cladding is to improve the transmission efficiency of the optical fibre. If cladding is not used, then the signal is attenuated dramatically.

\begin{document}

The angle of refraction at point \( P \) is \(\theta_p\). Let \( C \) be the critical angle at \( Q \), the interface of core and cladding:

\[
\sin C = \frac{n_1}{n_2}
\]

where \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the indices of refraction of the cladding and core, respectively. The angle of refraction \(\theta_p\) is given by:

\[
\theta_p = 90^\circ - \theta_{\text{in}}
\]

where \(\theta_{\text{in}}\) is the angle of incidence at \( Q \). Applying Snell's law:

\[
n_0 \sin \theta = n_2 \sin \theta_p = n_2 \sin(90^\circ - \theta_{\text{in}}) = n_2 \cos \theta_{\text{in}}
\]

For internal reflection, \(\theta_{\text{in}} > C\) or \(\cos \theta_{\text{in}} < \cos C\). Therefore:

\[
n_0 \sin \theta \leq n_2 \cos C
\]

But:

\[
n_2 \cos C = n_2 \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 C} = \sqrt{n_2^2 - n_1^2}
\]

Thus:

\[
n_0 \sin \theta \leq \sqrt{n_2^2 - n_1^2}
\]

This shows that there is a maximum angle of the acceptance cone outside of which entering rays will not be totally reflected within the fiber. For the largest acceptance cone, it is desirable to choose the index of refraction of the cladding to be as small as possible. This is achieved if there is no cladding at all. However, this leads to other problems associated with the loss of intensity.

\subsection*{(c) Transmission Reduction}

The transmission is reduced due to multiple reflections and the absorption of the fiber core material due to impurities.

\subsection*{Example Calculation}

With reference to Fig. 15.6, using Snell's law:

\[
n_2 \sin r_1 = n_1 \sin 20^\circ
\]

Thus:

\[
\sin r_1 = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1.1}{1.6} \times 0.342 = 0.2351
\]

Therefore:

\[
r_1 = 13.6^\circ
\]

From the geometry of Fig. 15.16:

\[
r_2 = 40^\circ - 13.6^\circ = 26.4^\circ \quad (\because r_1 + r_2 = A, \text{ the apex angle})
\]

Using Snell's law again:

\[
n_1 \sin i_2 = n_2 \sin r_2
\]

Thus:

\[
\sin i_2 = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \sin r_2 = \frac{1.6}{1.1} \sin 26.4^\circ = 0.6467
\]

Therefore:

\[
i_2 = 40.3^\circ
\]

The angle \(\phi\) is given by:

\[
\phi = 90^\circ - 40.3^\circ = 49.7^\circ
\]

And the angle \(\theta\) is:

\[
\theta = 80^\circ - 49.7^\circ = 30.3^\circ \quad (\because \text{The exterior angle is equal to the sum of the interior angles})
\]

\section*{Physics Problem Solution}

\subsection*{(a)}

Given:
\[
\sin C = \frac{1}{n_g} = \frac{1}{1.45} = 0.6896
\]

Thus, the critical angle \( C \) is:
\[
C = \sin^{-1}(0.6896) \approx 43.6^\circ
\]

\subsection*{(b)}

In applying Snell's law, instead of measuring angles with respect to the normal, we will measure them with respect to the interface for convenience. Thus, we have:
\[
1.2 \cos 45^\circ = 1.0 \cos \theta
\]

Solving for \( \theta \):
\[
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1.2 \cos 45^\circ}{1.0}\right) \approx 31.9^\circ
\]

From Fig. 15.17, since \( AC \) is parallel to \( EF \), we have:
\[
\angle BAC = \angle BCA = 45^\circ
\]

Thus, in triangle \( \triangle ADC \), the angle \( \alpha \) is:
\[
\alpha = 180^\circ - 2(\theta + 45^\circ) = 180^\circ - 2(31.9^\circ + 45^\circ) = 26.2^\circ

In the minimum angle position, we have:

\section*{Lens Equation and Image Formation}

The lens equation is given by:
\[
\frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f}
\]
where \( u \) is the object distance, and \( v \) is the image distance, both measured from the center of the lens. For real objects and images, \( u \) and \( v \) are positive. For virtual objects or images, \( u \) and \( v \) are negative. The focal length \( f \) is positive for a convex lens and negative for a concave lens.

Let the object \( O \) be placed at a distance \( u_1 \) from lens \( L_1 \) with focal length \( f_1 \). The second lens \( L_2 \) is placed at a distance \( d \) behind \( L_1 \), as shown in Fig. 15.19. The image \( I_1 \) is formed at a distance \( v_1 \) from lens \( L_1 \) alone. From the lens equation:
\[
\frac{1}{u_1} + \frac{1}{v_1} = \frac{1}{f_1}
\]
or
\[
v_1 = \frac{f_1 u_1}{u_1 - f_1} \tag{1}
\]

The image acts as an object for the second lens \( L_2 \) (real or virtual):
\[
-\frac{1}{v_1 - d} + \frac{1}{v_2} = \frac{1}{f_2}
\]

From Fig. 15.19, the image due to the combination of two lenses, a distance \( d \) apart, is given by:
\[
v_2 = \frac{f_2(v_1 - d)}{f_2 + v_1 - d}
\]

Substituting \( v_1 \) from (1) and simplifying, we get:
\[
v_2 = \frac{f_2 [f_1 u_1 - d(u_1 - f_1)]}{f_1 u_1 + (u_1 - f_1)(f_2 - d)} \tag{2}
\]

In the limit \( d \to 0 \), equation (2) reduces to:
\[
v_2 = \frac{f_1 f_2 u_1}{f_1 u_1 + f_2 u_1 - f_1 f_2}
\]
or
\[
\frac{1}{u_1} + \frac{1}{v_2} = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2}
\]

The size of the image relative to the size of the object is given by:

Therefore,

(c) Using the lens formula:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{u_1} + \frac{1}{v_1} = \frac{1}{f}

Substituting from equations (1), (2), and (4):
\begin{equation}
    \frac{2}{D + d} + \frac{2}{D - d} = \frac{1}{f}
\end{equation}

Thus,

    d^2 = \frac{Df(D - 4f)}{D}

\section*{Physics Problem: Lens and Refraction}

\subsection*{(a) Plano-Convex Lens}

Consider a plano-convex lens of focal length $f$. Let a paraxial ray be incident on the lens from a small object of height $h$. After striking the plano-convex lens normally, it gets refracted at the convex surface and passes through the principal focus $F$, behind the lens, as shown in Fig. 15.21. Let $\theta$ be the angle of incidence at $A$, the angle being measured with the radius of curvature of the curved surface $r$. Let $\phi$ be the angle of refraction.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Fig15_21.png}
    \caption{Refraction through a plano-convex lens}
\end{figure}

According to Snell's law:
\begin{equation}
    \sin \phi = n \sin \theta
\end{equation}

For small angles, we have:
\begin{equation}
    \phi = n \theta
\end{equation}

Also, we know:
\begin{equation}
    \theta = \frac{h}{r}, \quad \phi - \theta = \frac{h}{f}
\end{equation}

Combining equations (1) and (2), we derive:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{f} = \frac{n-1}{r}
\end{equation}

We use the convention that $r$ is positive if the refracting surface facing the object is convex, and $r$ is negative if the refracting surface facing the object is concave. A thin lens may be considered as two plano-convex or two plano-concave lenses in contact. Thus, a thin biconvex lens whose faces have radii of curvature $r_1$ and $r_2$ are considered as two plano-convex lenses with their plane surfaces cemented together:

\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{f_1} &= \frac{n-1}{r_1}, \\
    \frac{1}{f_2} &= \frac{n-1}{-r_2}
\end{align}

Therefore, the lens maker's formula is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{F} = (n-1) \left( \frac{1}{r_1} - \frac{1}{r_2} \right)
\end{equation}

For a biconvex lens, $r_1$ is positive and $r_2$ is negative. For a double-concave lens, $r_1$ is negative and $r_2$ is positive.

\subsection*{(b) Lens in a Medium}

If the lens of refractive index $n_1$ is immersed in a medium of index $n_2$, then $n = \frac{n_1}{n_2}$. For example, if $n_1 = 1.2$ and $n_2 = 1.33$, then $n = 0.9$, and the first bracket in equation (5) becomes $n - 1 = -0.1$, resulting in a negative value of $F$. Thus, the plastic lens immersed in water acts as a diverging lens.

\section*{Refraction through a Sphere}

Let a ray \( PA \) enter the sphere at \( A \), refract at \( A \) and \( B \), and intersect the axis at \( F \) (see Fig. 15.23). Let \(\phi\) be the angle of incidence and \(\theta\) the angle of refraction at \( A \):

\begin{equation}
    \sin \phi = \mu \sin \theta \quad \text{(Snell's law)}
\end{equation}

For small angles, we have:

\begin{equation}
    \phi = \mu \theta
\end{equation}

In \(\triangle \Delta 1 BFC\), we apply the sine rule:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{FC}{BC} = \frac{\sin \widehat{FBC}}{\sin \widehat{BFC}} = \frac{\sin(\pi - \phi)}{\sin 2(\phi - \theta)} = \frac{\sin \phi}{\sin 2(\phi - \theta)} = \frac{\phi}{2(\phi - \theta)}
\end{equation}

since the angles are small. Hence, the equivalent focal length \( F_{\text{eq}} = FC \) is given by:

\begin{equation}
    F_{\text{eq}} = \frac{BC \cdot \phi}{2(\phi - \theta)} = \frac{\mu r}{2(\mu - 1)}
\end{equation}

where we have used equations (2), (3), and (4).

\section*{Physics Problem and Solution}

\subsection*{(a)}

If the object distance is \( u \), then the distance \( v_1 \) at which the image is formed by the objective is given by

\[
\frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v_1} = \frac{1}{f_o}
\]

or

\[
v_1 = -\frac{uf_o}{u-f_o} \tag{1}
\]

The distance of this image from the eyepiece, \( u_1 \), is given by

\[
u_1 = f_o + f_e - \frac{uf_o}{u-f_o} = \frac{ufe - f_o^2 - f_o f_e}{u-f_o} \tag{2}
\]

where \( f_o + f_e \) is the distance between the objective and eyepiece. If the final image is formed at a distance \( v \) from the eyepiece, then

\[
\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u_1} = \frac{1}{f_e}
\]

or

\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f_e} - \frac{u-f_o}{ufe - f_o^2 - f_o f_e}
\]

or

\[
v = -\frac{f_e(ufe - f_o^2 - f_o f_e)}{f_o^2} \tag{3}
\]

Now, \( u \gg f_e, f_o \)

\[
v = -u \left(\frac{f_e}{f_o}\right)^2 = 10^4 \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 = 156.25 \, \text{m}
\]

\subsection*{(b)}

The magnification \( M \) is given by

\[
M = \frac{\text{Height of the final image}}{\text{Height of the object}} = \frac{v_1}{u} \times \frac{v}{u_1} \approx -\frac{f_e}{f_o} = -\frac{1}{8} = -0.125
\]

where we have used equations (1), (2), and (3). Therefore, the height of the final image is

\[
\text{Height of final image} = (\text{height of the object}) \times M = -100 \times 0.125 = -12.5 \, \text{m}
\]

The negative sign indicates that the final image is virtual. Note that the height of the image is only one-eighth of that of the object, but the image is closer than the object by a factor of 64, so it subtends an angle eight times larger, that is, the image appears eight times larger.

Assume that light is always incident from the left. Then the refracting surface is convex if $r$ is positive (from $V$ to $C$) and concave if $r$ is negative (from $V$ to $C'$), as shown in Fig. 15.24.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig15_24.png}
    \caption{Light is incident from the left. Sign convention for refraction at a curved optical surface.}
\end{figure}

The symbols used are: object distance $x_0$, object size $y_0$, image distance $x_i$, image size $y_i$, and radius of curvature $r$. The object-image equation can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    n_1 \left(-\frac{1}{x_0}\right) + n_2 \left(\frac{1}{x_i}\right) = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{r}
\end{equation}

The convention results in a negative value for the object distance. Paraxial rays are considered so that $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are small. Each ray is given a height and an angle, as shown in Fig. 15.25. The distance $\epsilon$ on the axis, called sagitta, is nearly zero. Considering counterclockwise angles as positive and clockwise angles as negative, equation (1) becomes:

\begin{equation}
    n_1 \alpha_1 l_1 + n_2 (-\alpha_2 l_2) = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{r}
\end{equation}

As $l_2 = l_1$, two simultaneous equations can be written in the variables $\alpha_j$ and $l_j$ ($j = 1, 2$):

\begin{equation}
    l_2 = l_1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \alpha_2 = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \alpha_1 - \left(\frac{n_2 - n_1}{n_2 r}\right) l_1
\end{equation}

In matrix form, equations (3) and (4) can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    l_2 \\
    \alpha_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    =

    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    l_1 \\
    \alpha_1
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The initial image in medium 1 described by the column vector $I_1 = \begin{pmatrix} l_1 \\ \alpha_1 \end{pmatrix}$ is transformed into the final image in medium 2 described by the column vector $I_2 = \begin{pmatrix} l_2 \\ \alpha_2 \end{pmatrix}$. The transformation is accomplished by the refraction matrix $R_{12}$:

\begin{equation}
    R_{12} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    \frac{1}{r} (n_1/n_2 - 1) & n_1/n_2
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

In matrix notation, equation (5) is written as:

\begin{equation}
    I_2 = R_{12} I_1
\end{equation}

Next, consider a parallel translation of a ray through a distance $d$ in some homogeneous medium, as shown in Fig. 15.26. Since $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$, for small angles:

\begin{equation}
    l_2 = l_1 + \alpha_1 d

At any point \( P \) on the screen at a distance \( y \) from the axis, the phase difference due to the waves coming from \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) will be due to the optical path difference \((S_2P - S_1P)\), as shown in Fig. 15.11:

\begin{equation}
    \delta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} (S_2P - S_1P)
\end{equation}

If \((S_2P - S_1P) = n\lambda\) where \( n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \), the phase difference \(\delta = 2n\pi\), and the intensity is maximum at \( P \):

If \((S_2P - S_1P) = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right) \lambda\), where \( m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \), the phase difference \(\delta = (2m + 1)\pi\) and the intensity will be zero at \( P \).

With reference to Fig. 15.11,

\begin{align}
    (S_2P)^2 &= L^2 + \left(x + \frac{d}{2}\right)^2 \\
    (S_1P)^2 &= L^2 + \left(x - \frac{d}{2}\right)^2
\end{align}

Thus,

\begin{align}
    (S_2P)^2 - (S_1P)^2 &= (S_2P + S_1P)(S_2P - S_1P) = 2xd
\end{align}

In practice, \( d \) is quite small, typically 0.5 mm, compared to \( L \), typically 1.0 m, and \( P \) is close to the axis, \( y \ll L \), so that \( S_1P \) as well as \( S_2P \) are only slightly greater than \( L \). We can then set \( S_2P + S_1P = 2L \). Therefore,

\begin{equation}
    S_2P - S_1P = \frac{2xd}{2L} = \frac{xd}{L}
\end{equation}

Therefore, the condition for maximum intensity at \( P \) is

\begin{equation}
    \frac{xd}{L} = m\lambda \quad \text{(bright fringes)}
\end{equation}

and the condition for zero intensity at \( P \) is

\begin{equation}
    \frac{xd}{L} = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda \quad \text{(dark fringes)}
\end{equation}

\( m \) is called the order of the fringe system. On the axis, at \( y = 0 \), \( m = 0 \) and we have the intensity maximum. The central bright band on the screen is flanked on either side by a series of bright and dark bands corresponding to \( m = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \), the \( m \)-th bright fringe being at a distance \( y_m \) from the axis:

\begin{equation}
    y_m = \frac{m\lambda L}{d}
\end{equation}

and the \((m+1)\)-th bright fringe being at a distance

\begin{equation}
    y_{m+1} = \frac{(m+1)\lambda L}{d}
\end{equation}

The separation of the fringes \(\beta\), called the bandwidth, is given by

\begin{equation}
    \Delta y = y_{m+1} - y_m = \beta = \frac{\lambda L}{d}

Let a transparent plate of thickness $t$ and refractive index $\mu$ be introduced in the path of one of the two interfering beams of monochromatic light, as shown in Fig. 15.30. A ray traveling from $S_1$ to $O$ covers a distance $t$ in the plate while the rest of the distance $(S_1O - t)$ is covered in air. The effective optical path length would be $\mu t + (S_1O - t)$ or $S_1O + (\mu - 1)t$. 

The optical path length for the ray emanating from $S_2$ would be $S_2O$. Clearly, $S_1O + (\mu - 1)t > S_2O$. Consequently, the central fringe corresponding to zero path difference is not formed at $O$, the normal position of the central fringe in the absence of the plate. The new position of the central fringe would be at $O'$ such that:

\[
S_1O' + (\mu - 1)t = S_2O'

But $S_2O' - S_1O' = \frac{d}{L} \cdot OO'$. Calling $OO' = \Delta_1$, the distance through which the central fringe shifts, we have:

\[
\Delta_1 = \frac{L}{d} (\mu - 1)t
\]

Furthermore, $(\mu - 1)t = n\lambda$. This shift is towards the side on which the plate is placed. Note that the bandwidth of the fringe system is unaffected and the entire fringe system undergoes a lateral shift. With the use of monochromatic light, it is not possible to detect the shift of fringes. However, if white light is used, then the central fringe being white is easily distinguished from the colored fringes and its shift can be easily measured. Thus, by the use of the above procedure, the thickness of the plate can be accurately measured.

\section*{Interference of Light Waves}

\subsection*{(a) Superposition of Two Light Waves}

Let two light waves of the same wavelength $\lambda$ and amplitude $A$ pass through a given point and be represented by

\begin{align}
    y_1 &= A \sin \omega t \label{eq:y1} \\
    y_2 &= A \sin (\omega t - \delta) \label{eq:y2}
\end{align}

where $\omega = 2\pi \nu$ and $\delta$ is the constant phase difference between the two waves. The resulting displacement is then given by

\begin{align}
    y &= y_1 + y_2 = A \sin \omega t + A \sin (\omega t - \delta) \nonumber \\
      &= 2A \cos \frac{\delta}{2} \sin \left( \omega t - \frac{\delta}{2} \right) \label{eq:resulting_displacement}
\end{align}

where we have used the identity

\begin{equation}
    \sin B + \sin C = 2 \sin \left( \frac{B+C}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{B-C}{2} \right) \label{eq:trig_identity}
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:resulting_displacement} represents simple harmonic vibration of frequency $\omega / 2\pi$ and amplitude $A' = 2A \cos(\delta/2)$. The amplitude of the resulting wave varies from $2A$ through $0$ to $-2A$ according to the value of $\delta$. The resulting intensity $I$ at the given point is proportional to the square of the amplitude or $A'^2$:

\begin{equation}
    I \propto 4A^2 \cos^2 \frac{\delta}{2} \label{eq:intensity}
\end{equation}

If $\delta = (2n+1)\pi \, (n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots)$ then $A' = 0$, i.e., the crests of one wave coincide with the troughs of the other, the two waves interfere destructively to give zero intensity, i.e., darkness. If $\delta = 2n\pi$, then $A' = 2A$, i.e., the two waves interfere constructively to produce maximum intensity of $4A^2$. Here the crests of one wave are an integral number of wavelengths ahead of the crest of the other so that the waves are reinforced. By eqn \eqref{eq:y1}, prob. (15.21),

\begin{equation}
    \delta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} (S_2P - S_1P) = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \left( \frac{dx}{L} \right) \implies I = 4A^2 \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi dx}{\lambda L} \right) \label{eq:intensity_distribution}
\end{equation}

Figure 15.31 shows the intensity distribution of Young’s fringes. Here $x$ is measured on the screen. The bright central fringe occurs at $x = 0$, in the centre of the fringe system. The other bright fringes are separated by distance, $x = \lambda L/d, 2\lambda L/d, 3\lambda L/d, \ldots$ on either side. Halfway between two neighbouring bright fringes, the centres of dark fringes occur. The light intensity does not drop off suddenly but varies as $\cos^2(\delta/2)$. At maxima, the intensity reaches a value of $4A^2$, and at minima, it is equal to zero. At other points, it is given by \eqref{eq:intensity_distribution}. Thus the intensity in the interference pattern varies between $4A^2$ and zero. In the absence of interference, each beam would contribute $A^2$ so that from two incoherent sources, there would be a uniform intensity of $2A^2$, which is indicated by the horizontal dotted line.

\subsection*{(b) Average Intensity of the Interference Pattern}

Now the average intensity of the interference pattern is obtained by averaging over the $\cos^2$ function in \eqref{eq:intensity_distribution}

First, we calculate the thickness of the air gap between the horizontal surface and the lower surface of the lens where Newton’s ring is formed as in Fig. 15.32. Let \( DE = t \) be the thickness of the air gap, \( CB = R \) be the radius of curvature of the lens, and \( DA = DB = r \) be the radius of the ring. From a theorem in geometry on intersecting chords, we have:

\[
DE \times DG = DA \times DB
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
t \times (2R - t) = r^2
\]

Assuming \( t \ll 2R \), we approximate:

\[
t = \frac{r^2}{2R} \tag{1}
\]

\subsection*{(a) Centres of curvature on the same side}

An air film \( BC \) is formed sandwiched between two curved surfaces of radii \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) in contact at \( O \). The centres of curvature of the lenses are on the same side, as shown in Fig. 15.33a. The thickness of the air film is given by:

\[
t = BC = AC - AB
\]

Using equation (1):

\[
AC = \frac{r_m^2}{2R_1}, \quad AB = \frac{r_m^2}{2R_2}
\]

Thus, the thickness \( t \) is:

\[
t = \frac{r_m^2}{2} \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right) \tag{2}
\]

where \( r_m \) is the radius of the \( m \)-th ring. For dark rings:

\[
2t = m\lambda \tag{3}
\]

Eliminating \( t \) between (2) and (3):

\[
r_m^2 \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right) = m\lambda \quad (m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \text{ dark rings}) \tag{4}
\]

For bright rings:

\[
2t = \left( m + \frac{1}{2} \right) \lambda \tag{5}
\]

Eliminating \( t \) between (2) and (5):

\[
r_m^2 \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right) = \left( m + \frac{1}{2} \right) \lambda \quad (m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \text{ bright rings}) \tag{6}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Centres of curvature on the opposite side}

The surfaces in contact at \( O \) are as shown in Fig. 15.33b; the thickness of the air film \( t \) is given by:

\[
AC = BC + AB
\]

Thus, the thickness \( t \) is:

\[
t = \frac{r_m^2}{2} \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right) \tag{7}
\]

For dark fringes:

\[
2t = m\lambda \tag{8}
\]

Eliminating \( t \) between (7) and (8):

\section*{Problem}

(a) The two mirrors $M_1$ and $M_2$ are adjusted such that their distance from the beam splitter are approximately equal, as shown in Fig. 15.4. The wavelengths $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ for the $D_1$ and $D_2$ lines of sodium differ only by a few angstroms. Two different sets of fringes arise due to these two wavelengths. If $M_1$ is slowly moved away, there is a gradual separation of the two sets, and finally, the bright band of one lies over the dark band of the other, resulting in uniform illumination. Thus, the fringes disappear and reappear periodically. Between two successive disappearances, the mirror has to be moved by, say, $d$ cm. This corresponds to a path difference of $2d$ cm. Assuming that $\lambda_2 < \lambda_1$, this path difference must contain exactly one more wavelength of $\lambda_2$ than of $\lambda_1$. Thus, expressing $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ in cm, we have:

\[
2d \lambda_2 - 2d \lambda_1 = 1
\]

\[
\therefore \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 = \Delta \lambda = \frac{\lambda_1 \lambda_2}{2d}

\section*{Problem}

(a) Let \( m \) be the order of interference. If the slit width \( a \) is maintained constant and the separation of the slits \( d \) is varied, the scale of the interference pattern varies, but that of the diffraction pattern remains unchanged. If the diffraction angle corresponds to the minimum given by equation (1), then a particular order of interference maxima may be absent. This is called a missing order. Thus, a missing order is realized for an angle \( \theta \) for which the following two equations are simultaneously satisfied:

\begin{equation}
d \sin \theta = m \lambda \quad (m = 1, 2, 3, \ldots)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
a \sin \theta = n \lambda \quad (n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots)
\end{equation}

Dividing equation (1) by equation (2), we have:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{a} = \frac{m}{n}
\end{equation}

Since \( m \) and \( n \) are both integers, missing orders will occur when \( d/a \) is in the ratio of two integers. Expressing \( d \) as the sum of the slit width \( a \) and the opaque space \( b \) between consecutive slits, that is:

\begin{equation}
d = a + b
\end{equation}

Equation (3) can be rewritten as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{a + b}{a} = \frac{m}{n}
\end{equation}

In particular, if \( \frac{a+b}{a} = 1 \), then \( b = 0 \). In this case, the first-order spectrum will be absent, and the resultant diffraction pattern will be similar to that of a single slit. If \( \frac{a+b}{a} = 2 \), then \( a = b \), that is, the width of the slit is equal to the width of the opaque space. Here, the second-order spectrum will be absent.

(b) Given:

\[

    &= \frac{I_0}{2} \cos^2 \theta (1 - \cos^2 \theta)
\end{align}

or

\begin{equation}
\frac{I_3}{I_0} = 0.1152 = \frac{1}{2} \cos^2 \theta (1 - \cos^2 \theta)
\end{equation}

which simplifies to

\begin{equation}
\cos^4 \theta - \cos^2 \theta + 0.2304 = 0
\end{equation}

Thus, solving for $\cos^2 \theta$ gives $\cos^2 \theta = 0.64$ or $0.36$, leading to $\cos \theta = \pm 0.8$ or $\pm 0.6$. Taking only the positive values, we find

\begin{equation}
\theta = 36.87^\circ \quad \text{or} \quad 53.13^\circ
\end{equation}

The polarization is along the $x$-axis.

Let an unpolarized light beam be incident from air on a dielectric such as glass. The electric field vector $\mathbf{E}$ for the wave can be resolved into two components: one parallel to the plane of incidence (the plane of the paper), and the second one perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The former is represented by a double arrow and is called the $\pi$-component, while the latter, shown by dots, is known as the $\sigma$-component; see Fig. 15.36.

For a given dielectric, there is a particular angle of incidence $i_p$, called the polarizing angle or Brewster angle, at which the reflected beam is completely polarized with its plane of vibration perpendicular to the plane of incidence, meaning the reflected beam contains the $\sigma$-component alone. Experiments show that at the polarizing angle, the reflected and refracted beams are at right angles. This leads to Brewster’s law:

\begin{equation}
    \tan i_p = \mu
\end{equation}

where $\mu$ is the refractive index. Note that at the polarizing angle, the $\pi$-component is entirely refracted, containing some amount of the $\sigma$-component as well. Thus, the transmitted light is only partially polarized. By using a stack of glass plates, the proportion of the $\sigma$-component can be increased in the reflected beam through multiple reflections, while the $\pi$-component can be enriched in the transmitted beam. Thus, the transmitted beam is rendered plane polarized with the plane of vibration in the plane of incidence.

Dielectrics such as glass and water can partially or fully polarize light by reflection. If the surface is horizontal, the light is partially or fully polarized horizontally, resulting in a bright spot (the glare) on the surface where reflection takes place. Such glare from horizontal surfaces is eliminated by mounting the lenses in polarizing glasses with their polarizing direction vertical.

Brewster windows are used in laser technology (Fig. 15.37). The tubes of gas lasers are sealed by mounting them such that laser light is incident at Brewster’s angle. Mirrors mounted outside the tube reflect the light back and forth through the tube. A small hole in one mirror permits the laser light to leave. Because the windows are tilted to the axis such that light is incident at Brewster’s angle, the parallel component can traverse back and forth in the tube with minimum attenuation. The perpendicular component, after several traversals, gets substantially attenuated. Thus, the light leaving the laser is polarized in the parallel direction.

\begin{equation}
    \tan \theta_B = \mu = 1.5 \quad \therefore \quad \theta_B = 56.3^\circ
\end{equation}

This angle is also the inclination of the Brewster window.
