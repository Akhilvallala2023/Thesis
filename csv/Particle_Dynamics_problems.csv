Three blocks of masses $m_1$, $m_2$, and $m_3$ are interconnected by cords and are pulled by a constant force $F$ on a frictionless horizontal table, as shown in Fig. 2.1. Find:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The common acceleration $a$.

\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Common Acceleration $a$}

The total mass of the system is the sum of the masses of the three blocks:
\[
M = m_1 + m_2 + m_3
\]

The net force acting on the system is $F$, and using Newton's second law, the common acceleration $a$ can be found as:
\[
a = \frac{F}{M} = \frac{F}{m_1 + m_2 + m_3}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Tensions $T_1$ and $T_2$}

To find the tension $T_1$, consider the system consisting of blocks $m_2$ and $m_3$:
\[
T_1 = (m_2 + m_3) \cdot a = (m_2 + m_3) \cdot \frac{F}{m_1 + m_2 + m_3}
\]

To find the tension $T_2$, consider the block $m_3$:
\[
T_2 = m_3 \cdot a = m_3 \cdot \frac{F}{m_1 + m_2 + m_3}
\]

\section*{Problem Statement}

A block of mass $M$ on a rough horizontal table is driven by another block of mass $m$ connected by a thread passing over a frictionless pulley. Assuming that the coefficient of friction between the mass $M$ and the table is $\mu$, find:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The acceleration of the masses.

    \label{fig:2.2}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Acceleration of the masses}

Let's denote the acceleration of the masses as $a$. Applying Newton's second law to each block, we have:

For the block of mass $M$ on the table:
\[
T - \mu M g = M a
\]

For the hanging block of mass $m$:
\[
m g - T = m a
\]

Adding these two equations, we eliminate $T$:
\[
m g - \mu M g = (M + m) a
\]

Solving for $a$, we get:
\[
a = \frac{m g - \mu M g}{M + m}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Tension in the thread}

Substitute the expression for $a$ back into one of the original equations to find $T$. Using the equation for the block on the table:
\[
T = M a + \mu M g
\]

Substitute $a$:
\[
T = M \left( \frac{m g - \mu M g}{M + m} \right) + \mu M g
\]

Simplify to find the tension $T$.

\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The maximum force $F_{\text{max}}$ that can be applied to $m_2$ without causing $m_1$ to slide is equal to the maximum static frictional force:

\begin{equation}
    F_{\text{max}} = f_{\text{max}} = \mu m_1 g

\section*{Problem Statement}

Two blocks, $m_1$ and $m_2$, are in contact on a frictionless table. A horizontal force $F$ is applied to the block $m_1$, as shown in Figure 2.4(a).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Find the force of contact between the blocks.
    \item[(b)] Find the force of contact between the blocks if the same force is applied to $m_2$ rather than to $m_1$, as shown in Figure 2.4(b).
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Force of Contact when $F$ is Applied to $m_1$}

When the force $F$ is applied to $m_1$, the entire system (both blocks) accelerates with the same acceleration $a$. The acceleration can be found using Newton's second law:

\[
a = \frac{F}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

The force of contact $F_c$ between the blocks is the force that $m_1$ exerts on $m_2$. Using Newton's second law for block $m_2$, we have:

\[
F_c = m_2 \cdot a = m_2 \cdot \frac{F}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Force of Contact when $F$ is Applied to $m_2$}

If the force $F$ is applied to $m_2$, the acceleration of the system is still:

\[
a = \frac{F}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

Now, the force of contact $F_c$ is the force that $m_2$ exerts on $m_1$. Using Newton's second law for block $m_1$, we have:

F_c = m_1 \cdot a = m_1 \cdot \frac{F}{m_1 + m_2}

\section*{Problem}

A uniform chain of length $L$ lies on a table. If the coefficient of friction is $\mu$, what is the maximum length of the part of the chain hanging over the table such that the chain does not slide?

\section*{Solution}

Let $x$ be the length of the chain hanging over the edge of the table. The weight of the hanging part of the chain is proportional to its length, so it is given by $x \cdot \lambda g$, where $\lambda$ is the linear mass density of the chain and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The weight of the part of the chain on the table is $(L - x) \cdot \lambda g$.

The frictional force, which prevents the chain from sliding, is given by:
\[
f_{\text{friction}} = \mu (L - x) \lambda g
\]

For the chain to be in equilibrium and not slide, the frictional force must be equal to or greater than the weight of the hanging part of the chain:
\[
\mu (L - x) \lambda g \geq x \lambda g
\]

Dividing both sides by $\lambda g$, we get:
\[
\mu (L - x) \geq x
\]

Rearranging the inequality, we find:
\[
\mu L \geq x (1 + \mu)
\]

Solving for $x$, we obtain:
\[
x \leq \frac{\mu L}{1 + \mu}
\]

Thus, the maximum length of the part of the chain hanging over the table such that the chain does not slide is:
\[
x_{\text{max}} = \frac{\mu L}{1 + \mu}

\section*{Problem}

A uniform chain of length $L$ and mass $M$ is lying on a smooth table, and one-third of its length is hanging vertically down over the edge of the table. Find the work required to pull the hanging part onto the table.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we first determine the mass of the hanging part of the chain. Since the chain is uniform, the mass per unit length is $\frac{M}{L}$. The length of the hanging part is $\frac{L}{3}$, so its mass is:
\[
m = \frac{M}{L} \cdot \frac{L}{3} = \frac{M}{3}
\]

The center of mass of the hanging part is at its midpoint, which is at a distance of $\frac{L}{6}$ below the table. The work done to lift the hanging part onto the table is equal to the gravitational potential energy gained by the hanging part. This is given by:
\[
W = mgh
\]
where $h = \frac{L}{6}$ is the height the center of mass is lifted, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Substituting the values, we have:
\[
W = \left(\frac{M}{3}\right) g \left(\frac{L}{6}\right) = \frac{MgL}{18}
\]

Thus, the work required to pull the hanging part onto the table is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{MgL}{18}}

\title{Physics Problem: Block on an Inclined Plane}
\author{Indian Institute of Technology 1976}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

A block of mass \( m = 2 \, \text{kg} \) slides on an inclined plane that makes an angle of \( \theta = 30^\circ \) with the horizontal. The coefficient of friction between the block and the surface is \( \mu = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] What force should be applied to the block so that it moves down without any acceleration?
    \item[(b)] What force should be applied to the block so that it moves up without any acceleration?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Force for Downward Movement Without Acceleration}

To find the force \( F_d \) required for the block to move down without acceleration, we start by considering the forces acting on the block:

- Gravitational force component along the plane: \( mg \sin \theta \)
- Frictional force opposing the motion: \( \mu mg \cos \theta \)

For the block to move down without acceleration, the net force along the plane must be zero:

\[
F_d + \mu mg \cos \theta = mg \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \( F_d \):

\[
F_d = mg \sin \theta - \mu mg \cos \theta
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
F_d = 2 \times 9.8 \times \sin 30^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 2 \times 9.8 \times \cos 30^\circ
\]

\[
F_d = 19.6 \times 0.5 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 19.6 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

\[
F_d = 9.8 - 14.7 = -4.9 \, \text{N}
\]

Thus, a force of \( 4.9 \, \text{N} \) must be applied upward along the plane to prevent acceleration.

\subsection*{(b) Force for Upward Movement Without Acceleration}

For the block to move up without acceleration, the applied force \( F_u \) must overcome both the gravitational component and the frictional force:

\[
F_u = mg \sin \theta + \mu mg \cos \theta
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
F_u = 2 \times 9.8 \times \sin 30^\circ + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 2 \times 9.8 \times \cos 30^\circ
\]

\[
F_u = 19.6 \times 0.5 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 19.6 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

\[
F_u = 9.8 + 14.7 = 24.5 \, \text{N}
\]

Thus, a force of \( 24.5 \, \text{N} \) must be applied upward along the plane to prevent acceleration.

\section*{Physics Problem: Inclined Plane with Pulley System}

Consider a fixed inclined plane at angle $\theta$. Two blocks of masses $M_1$ and $M_2$ are attached by a string passing over a pulley of radius $r$ and moment of inertia $I_1$ as shown in Fig. 2.8.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] \textbf{Find the net torque acting on the system comprising the two masses, pulley, and the string.}

    The net torque $\tau$ on the system is given by the difference in gravitational forces acting on the two masses, which causes the pulley to rotate. Assuming the string does not slip on the pulley, the torque is:
    \[
    \tau = r (M_2 g \sin \theta - M_1 g \sin \theta)
    \]
    where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

    \item[(b)] \textbf{Find the total angular momentum of the system about the center of the pulley when the blocks are moving with speed $v$.}

    The total angular momentum $L$ of the system is the sum of the angular momentum of the pulley and the linear momentum of the blocks converted to angular form:
    \[
    L = I_1 \omega + M_1 v r + M_2 v r
    \]
    where $\omega = \frac{v}{r}$ is the angular velocity of the pulley.

    \item[(c)] \textbf{Calculate the acceleration of the blocks.}

    Using Newton's second law for rotation and translation, the net force on the system is:
    \[
    M_2 g \sin \theta - M_1 g \sin \theta = (M_1 + M_2) a + \frac{I_1 a}{r^2}
    \]
    Solving for the acceleration $a$, we get:
    \[
    a = \frac{(M_2 - M_1) g \sin \theta}{M_1 + M_2 + \frac{I_1}{r^2}}

2.13,"To solve this problem, we'll need to apply Newton's second law and consider the forces acting on the box along the inclined plane. Let's denote the mass of the box as \( m = 1 \, \text{kg} \), the angle of the incline as \( \theta = 30^\circ \), and the acceleration due to gravity as \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

The gravitational force component along the incline is \( mg \sin \theta \), and the normal force is \( mg \cos \theta \). We need to find the force \( F \) that must be applied parallel to the incline to achieve the desired accelerations.

### (a) Moving Up the Incline with an Acceleration of \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

For the box to move up the incline with an acceleration \( a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), the net force equation along the incline is:

\[
F - mg \sin \theta = ma
\]

Solving for \( F \):

\[
F = m(a + g \sin \theta)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
F = 1 \, \text{kg} \left(1 \, \text{m/s}^2 + 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \cdot \sin 30^\circ \right)
\]

Since \(\sin 30^\circ = 0.5\):

\[
F = 1 \, \text{kg} \left(1 \, \text{m/s}^2 + 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \cdot 0.5 \right)
\]

\[
F = 1 \, \text{kg} \left(1 \, \text{m/s}^2 + 4.905 \, \text{m/s}^2 \right)
\]

\[
F = 5.905 \, \text{N}
\]

### (b) Moving Down the Incline with an Acceleration of \( 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

For the box to move down the incline with an acceleration \( a = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), the net force equation along the incline is:

\[
mg \sin \theta - F = ma
\]

Solving for \( F \):

\[
F = mg \sin \theta - ma
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
F = 1 \, \text{kg} \left(9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \cdot \sin 30^\circ - 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \right)
\]

\[
F = 1 \, \text{kg} \left(4.905 \, \text{m/s}^2 - 1 \, \text{m/s}^2 \right)
\]

\[
F = 3.905 \, \text{N}

Thus, the constant forces required are \( 5.905 \, \text{N} \) to move up the incline and \( 3.905 \, \text{N} \) to move down the incline."

Assume that all surfaces are frictionless, and the incline makes an angle \( \theta \) with the horizontal. The mass \( m \) is released from rest on mass \( M \), which is also initially at rest.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we need to apply Newton's second law to both masses. Let's denote:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( a_M \) as the acceleration of the wedge \( M \) in the horizontal direction.
    \item \( a_m \) as the acceleration of the mass \( m \) along the incline.
\end{itemize}

Assuming no friction and using the coordinate system aligned with the incline, we have:

\begin{align*}
    \text{For mass } m: & \quad m g \sin \theta - N = m a_m, \\
    \text{For mass } M: & \quad N \cos \theta = M a_M,
\end{align*}

where \( N \) is the normal force between the wedge and the mass \( m \).

Since there is no friction, the horizontal component of the normal force provides the acceleration to the wedge:

\[
N \sin \theta = M a_M
\]

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the expressions for \( a_M \) and \( a_m \).

\section*{Atwood Machine Problem}

Consider an Atwood machine with two masses, $m_1 = 1.9\, \text{kg}$ and $m_2 = 2.1\, \text{kg}$. The initial vertical distance between the heavier mass ($m_2$) and the lighter mass ($m_1$) is $d = 20\, \text{cm} = 0.2\, \text{m}$. We need to find the time $t$ after which the lighter mass is above the heavier mass by the same vertical distance.

\subsection*{Solution}

The acceleration $a$ of the system can be determined using the formula for an Atwood machine:

\[
a = \frac{(m_2 - m_1)g}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

where $g = 9.81\, \text{m/s}^2$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

Substituting the given values:

\[
a = \frac{(2.1 - 1.9) \times 9.81}{1.9 + 2.1} = \frac{0.2 \times 9.81}{4.0} = \frac{1.962}{4.0} = 0.4905\, \text{m/s}^2
\]

The total distance the lighter mass needs to travel to be $0.2\, \text{m}$ above the heavier mass is $2d = 0.4\, \text{m}$.

Using the kinematic equation for constant acceleration:

\[
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2

where $s = 0.4\, \text{m}$, $u = 0\, \text{m/s}$ (initial velocity), and $a = 0.4905\, \text{m/s}^2$.

Solving for $t$:

\[
0.4 = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \times 0.4905 \times t^2
\]

\[
0.4 = 0.24525 \times t^2
\]

\[
t^2 = \frac{0.4}{0.24525}
\]

\[
t^2 \approx 1.631
\]

\[
t \approx \sqrt{1.631} \approx 1.277\, \text{s}
\]

Thus, the time after which the lighter body will be above the heavier body by the same vertical distance is approximately $1.277\, \text{seconds}$.

2.18,"To solve this problem, we need to compare the time taken to slide down a rough inclined plane to the time taken to slide down a smooth inclined plane. Let's denote:

- \( t_1 \) as the time taken to slide down the smooth inclined plane.
- \( t_2 = \frac{4}{3} t_1 \) as the time taken to slide down the rough inclined plane.
- \( \theta = 45^\circ \) as the angle of incline.
- \( \mu \) as the coefficient of friction on the rough inclined plane.

### Solution

For the smooth inclined plane, the only force causing acceleration is the component of gravity along the plane. The acceleration \( a_1 \) is given by:

\[
a_1 = g \sin \theta
\]

For the rough inclined plane, the acceleration \( a_2 \) is reduced by the frictional force. The net acceleration is:

\[
a_2 = g \sin \theta - \mu g \cos \theta
\]

Given that \( t_2 = \frac{4}{3} t_1 \), and using the kinematic equation for constant acceleration \( s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \), where \( s \) is the distance traveled (same for both planes), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2} a_1 t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} a_2 t_2^2
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \), we get:

\[
g \sin \theta \cdot t_1^2 = \left( g \sin \theta - \mu g \cos \theta \right) \left( \frac{4}{3} t_1 \right)^2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
g \sin \theta \cdot t_1^2 = \left( g \sin \theta - \mu g \cos \theta \right) \cdot \frac{16}{9} t_1^2
\]

Canceling \( g \) and \( t_1^2 \), and solving for \( \mu \):

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{16}{9} \left( \sin \theta - \mu \cos \theta \right)
\]

\[
9 \sin \theta = 16 \sin \theta - 16 \mu \cos \theta
\]

\[
16 \mu \cos \theta = 16 \sin \theta - 9 \sin \theta
\]

\[
16 \mu \cos \theta = 7 \sin \theta
\]

\[
\mu = \frac{7 \sin \theta}{16 \cos \theta}
\]

Since \( \theta = 45^\circ \), we have \( \sin 45^\circ = \cos 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\mu = \frac{7 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{16 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{7}{16}
\]

Thus, the coefficient of friction is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{7}{16}}

\section*{Problem}
Two masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are connected by a light inextensible string which passes over a smooth massless pulley. Find the acceleration of the center of mass of the system.

\section*{Solution}

To find the acceleration of the center of mass of the system, we start by analyzing the forces acting on each mass. Assume \( m_1 \) is on the left side and \( m_2 \) is on the right side of the pulley.

The tension \( T \) in the string is the same on both sides due to the string being light and inextensible and the pulley being massless and smooth. The forces acting on the masses are:

\[
\begin{align*}
m_1: & \quad T - m_1 g = m_1 a_1, \\
m_2: & \quad m_2 g - T = m_2 a_2.
\end{align*}
\]

Here, \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) are the accelerations of \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) respectively. Since the string is inextensible, the magnitudes of the accelerations are equal, i.e., \( a_1 = a_2 = a \).

Adding the two equations, we get:

\[
T - m_1 g + m_2 g - T = m_1 a + m_2 a.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
(m_2 - m_1)g = (m_1 + m_2)a.
\]

Solving for \( a \), the acceleration of the masses, we have:

\[
a = \frac{(m_2 - m_1)g}{m_1 + m_2}.
\]

The acceleration of the center of mass \( a_{\text{cm}} \) of the system is given by:

\[
a_{\text{cm}} = \frac{m_1 a_1 + m_2 a_2}{m_1 + m_2}.
\]

Since \( a_1 = a_2 = a \), we have:

\[
a_{\text{cm}} = \frac{m_1 a + m_2 a}{m_1 + m_2} = a.
\]

Thus, the acceleration of the center of mass of the system is:

\[
a_{\text{cm}} = \frac{(m_2 - m_1)g}{m_1 + m_2}.

\title{Physics Problem: Acceleration of Block $m_1$}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

Two blocks with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ are attached by an unstretchable string around a frictionless pulley of radius $r$ and moment of inertia $I$. Assume that there is no slipping of the string over the pulley and that the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two blocks and between the lower one and the floor is identical. If a horizontal force $F$ is applied to $m_1$, calculate the acceleration of $m_1$ (see Fig. 2.12).

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig2_12.png} % Replace with actual figure file if available
    \caption{Diagram illustrating the setup of the blocks and pulley system.}
    \label{fig:2.12}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

To find the acceleration of $m_1$, we need to consider the forces acting on the system. The forces include the applied force $F$, the tension in the string $T$, and the frictional forces. The equations of motion for the blocks and the pulley can be written as follows:

\begin{align}
    F - T - f_k &= m_1 a, \\
    T - f_k &= m_2 a, \\
    T r &= I \alpha,
\end{align}

where $f_k$ is the kinetic friction force, $a$ is the linear acceleration of the blocks, and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration of the pulley. Since the string does not slip, we have the relation $a = r \alpha$.

The kinetic friction force can be expressed as $f_k = \mu_k N$, where $\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction and $N$ is the normal force. Assuming the normal force is equal to the weight of the blocks, we have $N = m_1 g + m_2 g$.

Substituting these into the equations and solving for $a$ will yield the desired acceleration of $m_1$.

2.22,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total work done by the forces \( \mathbf{F}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{F}_2 \) on the particle as it moves from position \( \mathbf{r}_2 \) to position \( \mathbf{r}_1 \). The work done by a force \( \mathbf{F} \) during a displacement \( \Delta \mathbf{r} \) is given by the dot product:

\[
W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{r}
\]

First, we determine the displacement \( \Delta \mathbf{r} \):

\[
\Delta \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2 = (20\hat{\imath} + 15\hat{\jmath} + 0\hat{k}) \, \text{cm} - (0\hat{\imath} + 0\hat{\jmath} + 7\hat{k}) \, \text{cm}
\]

\[
\Delta \mathbf{r} = 20\hat{\imath} + 15\hat{\jmath} - 7\hat{k} \, \text{cm}
\]

Convert the displacement to meters:

\[
\Delta \mathbf{r} = 0.20\hat{\imath} + 0.15\hat{\jmath} - 0.07\hat{k} \, \text{m}
\]

The total force \( \mathbf{F}_{\text{total}} \) is the sum of \( \mathbf{F}_1 \) and \( \mathbf{F}_2 \):

\[
\mathbf{F}_{\text{total}} = \mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{F}_2 = (1\hat{\imath} + 2\hat{\jmath} + 3\hat{k}) \, \text{N} + (4\hat{\imath} - 5\hat{\jmath} - 2\hat{k}) \, \text{N}
\]

\[
\mathbf{F}_{\text{total}} = (1 + 4)\hat{\imath} + (2 - 5)\hat{\jmath} + (3 - 2)\hat{k} = 5\hat{\imath} - 3\hat{\jmath} + 1\hat{k} \, \text{N}
\]

Now, calculate the work done:

\[
W = \mathbf{F}_{\text{total}} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{r} = (5\hat{\imath} - 3\hat{\jmath} + 1\hat{k}) \cdot (0.20\hat{\imath} + 0.15\hat{\jmath} - 0.07\hat{k})
\]

\[
W = 5 \times 0.20 + (-3) \times 0.15 + 1 \times (-0.07)
\]

\[
W = 1.00 - 0.45 - 0.07
\]

\[
W = 0.48 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the total work done on the particle is \(\boxed{0.48 \, \text{J}}\)."
2.23,"To format the given physics problem in LaTeX, we need to include the potential energy function, find the force by taking the derivative, and determine the equilibrium positions. Here is the LaTeX code for the problem:

```latex
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

The potential energy of an object is given by 
\[
U(x) = 5x^2 - 4x^3
\]
where \( U \) is in joules and \( x \) is in metres.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] What is the force, \( F(x) \), acting on the object?

    The force \( F(x) \) is given by the negative gradient of the potential energy:
    \[
    F(x) = -\frac{dU}{dx}
    \]
    Calculating the derivative, we have:
    \[
    \frac{dU}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}(5x^2 - 4x^3) = 10x - 12x^2
    \]
    Therefore, the force is:
    \[
    F(x) = -(10x - 12x^2) = -10x + 12x^2
    \]

    \item[(ii)] Determine the positions where the object is in equilibrium and state whether they are stable or unstable.

    The object is in equilibrium when the force is zero:
    \[
    F(x) = -10x + 12x^2 = 0
    \]
    Factoring out \( x \), we get:
    \[
    x(-10 + 12x) = 0
    \]
    This gives the equilibrium positions:
    \[
    x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{5}{6}
    \]

    To determine stability, we examine the second derivative of the potential energy:
    \[
    \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = \frac{d}{dx}(10x - 12x^2) = 10 - 24x
    \]

    \begin{itemize}
        \item At \( x = 0 \):
        \[
        \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} \bigg|_{x=0} = 10 > 0
        \]
        This indicates a stable equilibrium.

        \item At \( x = \frac{5}{6} \):
        \[
        \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} \bigg|_{x=\frac{5}{6}} = 10 - 24 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 - 20 = -10 < 0

        This indicates an unstable equilibrium.

\section*{Physics Problem}

A body slides down a rough plane inclined to the horizontal at $30^\circ$. If 70\% of the initial potential energy is dissipated during the descent, find the coefficient of sliding friction. [University of Bristol]

\section*{Solution}

Let's denote:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $m$ as the mass of the body,
    \item $g$ as the acceleration due to gravity,
    \item $h$ as the initial height of the body,
    \item $\mu$ as the coefficient of sliding friction,
    \item $\theta = 30^\circ$ as the angle of inclination.
\end{itemize}

The initial potential energy ($PE_{\text{initial}}$) is given by:
\[
PE_{\text{initial}} = mgh
\]

Since 70\% of the initial potential energy is dissipated, the energy dissipated ($E_{\text{dissipated}}$) is:
\[
E_{\text{dissipated}} = 0.7 \times mgh
\]

The work done against friction ($W_{\text{friction}}$) is equal to the energy dissipated:
\[
W_{\text{friction}} = \mu mg \cos\theta \cdot d
\]

where $d$ is the distance traveled along the plane. Since $d = \frac{h}{\sin\theta}$, we have:
\[
W_{\text{friction}} = \mu mg \cos\theta \cdot \frac{h}{\sin\theta}
\]

Equating the work done against friction to the energy dissipated:
\[
\mu mg \cos\theta \cdot \frac{h}{\sin\theta} = 0.7 \times mgh
\]

Canceling $mg$ and $h$ from both sides, we get:
\[
\mu \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta} = 0.7
\]

Since $\frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta} = \cot\theta$, we have:
\[
\mu \cot\theta = 0.7
\]

Substituting $\theta = 30^\circ$, where $\cot 30^\circ = \sqrt{3}$, we find:
\[
\mu \sqrt{3} = 0.7
\]

Thus, the coefficient of sliding friction $\mu$ is:
\[
\mu = \frac{0.7}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we start by considering the energy conservation and the work done by friction.

1. **Energy Conservation:**

   The potential energy at the top of the ramp is converted into kinetic energy at the bottom:
   \[
   mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
   \]
   Solving for $v$, the velocity at the bottom of the ramp, we get:
   \[
   v = \sqrt{2gh}
   \]

2. **Work Done by Friction:**

   The work done by friction to stop the object is equal to the kinetic energy at the bottom:
   \[
   \mu mgd = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
   \]

   Substituting $v = \sqrt{2gh}$ into the equation:
   \[
   \mu mgd = \frac{1}{2}m(2gh)
   \]

   Simplifying, we find the stopping distance $d$:
   \[
   \mu mgd = mgh \quad \Rightarrow \quad d = \frac{h}{\mu}
   \]

Thus, the distance $d$ necessary to stop the object on the flat track is $\frac{h}{\mu}$.

    \item[(b)] Show that neither ball can be scattered in the backward direction.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] To show that the final velocity vectors of the two objects are orthogonal, we start by considering the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy. Let the initial velocity of the moving object be $\mathbf{v}_0$ and the masses of both objects be $m$. The initial momentum is given by:
    \begin{align}
        \mathbf{p}_\text{initial} = m \mathbf{v}_0.
    \end{align}
    After the collision, let the velocities of the two objects be $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$. The conservation of momentum gives:
    \begin{align}
        m \mathbf{v}_0 = m \mathbf{v}_1 + m \mathbf{v}_2.
    \end{align}
    Simplifying, we have:
    \begin{align}
        \mathbf{v}_0 = \mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2.
    \end{align}
    The conservation of kinetic energy is:
    \begin{align}
        \frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m v_2^2.
    \end{align}
    Simplifying, we have:
    \begin{align}
        v_0^2 = v_1^2 + v_2^2.
    \end{align}
    From equations (3) and (5), we recognize this as the Pythagorean theorem, which implies that $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ are orthogonal:
    \begin{align}
        \mathbf{v}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_2 = 0.
    \end{align}

    \item[(b)] To show that neither ball can be scattered in the backward direction, consider the geometry of the collision. If either ball were to scatter backward, its velocity vector would have a component in the direction opposite to $\mathbf{v}_0$. However, since $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ are orthogonal and the initial momentum is in the direction of $\mathbf{v}_0$, neither $\mathbf{v}_1$ nor $\mathbf{v}_2$ can have a component in the opposite direction of $\mathbf{v}_0$. Thus, neither ball can be scattered in the backward direction.

\section*{Problem Statement}

A small ball of mass $m$ is projected horizontally with velocity $v$. It hits a spring of spring constant $k$ attached inside an opening of a block resting on a frictionless horizontal surface. Find the compression of the spring noting that the block will slide due to the impact (see Fig. 2.15).

    \caption{Illustration of the problem setup (Fig. 2.15)}
    \label{fig:2_15}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we need to consider the conservation of momentum and energy. Initially, the ball has momentum, and upon impact, the system consisting of the ball, block, and spring will have a combined momentum and energy.

\subsection*{Conservation of Momentum}

Initially, the momentum of the system is given by the momentum of the ball:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = mv
\]

After the impact, the momentum of the system (ball + block) is:
\[
p_{\text{final}} = (m + M)V
\]
where $M$ is the mass of the block and $V$ is the velocity of the block and ball system after the impact.

By conservation of momentum:
\[
mv = (m + M)V
\]

Solving for $V$, we get:
\[
V = \frac{mv}{m + M}
\]

\subsection*{Conservation of Energy}

The kinetic energy of the system after the impact is converted into the potential energy of the spring:
\[
\frac{1}{2}(m + M)V^2 = \frac{1}{2}kx^2
\]
where $x$ is the compression of the spring.

Substituting $V$ from the momentum equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}(m + M)\left(\frac{mv}{m + M}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}kx^2
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\frac{m^2v^2}{2(m + M)} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2
\]

Solving for $x$, the compression of the spring:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{m^2v^2}{k(m + M)}}
\]

Thus, the compression of the spring is given by:
\[
x = \frac{mv}{\sqrt{k(m + M)}}
\]

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Two spheres of mass $4m$ are at rest.
   - A sphere of mass $m$ is moving towards them.

2. **Conservation of Momentum:**
   \[
   m v_i = m v_f + 4m u_f
   \]
   where $v_i$ is the initial velocity of the moving sphere, $v_f$ is its final velocity after collision, and $u_f$ is the velocity of the $4m$ sphere after collision.

   \[
   \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2 + \frac{1}{2} 4m u_f^2

    \text{Initial kinetic energy of particle 2:} & \quad \frac{1}{2} m_2 (\alpha u_2)^2.
\end{align*}

Since the initial kinetic energies are equal, we have:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 (\alpha u_2)^2.
\end{equation}

Simplifying, we get:
\begin{equation}
    m_1 u_1^2 = m_2 \alpha^2 u_2^2.
\end{equation}

For an elastic collision, the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy must hold. The momentum conservation before and after the collision is given by:
\begin{equation}
    m_1 u_1 + m_2 \alpha u_2 = m_1 \cdot 0 + m_2 v_2',
\end{equation}
where $v_2'$ is the velocity of $m_2$ after the collision.

Since $m_1$ is at rest after the collision, we have:
\begin{equation}
    m_1 u_1 = m_2 v_2'.
\end{equation}

Using the kinetic energy equality and solving for the ratios, we find:
\begin{align}
    \frac{m_1}{m_2} &= \alpha^2, \\
    \frac{u_1}{u_2} &= \alpha.
\end{align}

Thus, the required ratios are:
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \alpha^2 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{u_1}{u_2} = \alpha.}

\section*{Problem}

A neutron moving with velocity $v_0$ collides head-on with a carbon nucleus of mass number 12. Assuming that the collision is elastic, (a) calculate the fraction of the neutron's kinetic energy transferred to the carbon nucleus and (b) calculate the velocities of the neutron and the carbon nucleus after the collision.

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Fraction of Kinetic Energy Transferred}

In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Let $m_n$ be the mass of the neutron and $m_c = 12m_n$ be the mass of the carbon nucleus.

The initial kinetic energy of the neutron is:
\[
K_{i,n} = \frac{1}{2} m_n v_0^2
\]

The final kinetic energy of the carbon nucleus is:
\[
K_{f,c} = \frac{1}{2} m_c v_c^2
\]

Using the conservation of momentum:
\[
m_n v_0 = m_n v_n + m_c v_c
\]

Using the conservation of kinetic energy:
\[
\frac{1}{2} m_n v_0^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_n v_n^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_c v_c^2
\]

The fraction of kinetic energy transferred to the carbon nucleus is:
\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{K_{f,c}}{K_{i,n}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} m_c v_c^2}{\frac{1}{2} m_n v_0^2} = \frac{m_c v_c^2}{m_n v_0^2}
\]

Solving the equations, we find:
\[
v_c = \frac{2m_n}{m_n + m_c} v_0
\]

Substituting $m_c = 12m_n$:
\[
v_c = \frac{2m_n}{m_n + 12m_n} v_0 = \frac{2}{13} v_0
\]

Thus, the fraction of kinetic energy transferred is:
\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{m_c \left(\frac{2}{13} v_0\right)^2}{m_n v_0^2} = \frac{12m_n \left(\frac{4}{169} v_0^2\right)}{m_n v_0^2} = \frac{48}{169}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Velocities After the Collision}

Using the conservation of momentum:
\[
m_n v_0 = m_n v_n + 12m_n v_c
\]

Substitute $v_c = \frac{2}{13} v_0$:
\[
v_n = v_0 - 12 \left(\frac{2}{13} v_0\right) = v_0 - \frac{24}{13} v_0 = \frac{1}{13} v_0
\]

Thus, the velocities after the collision are:
\[
v_n = \frac{1}{13} v_0, \quad v_c = \frac{2}{13} v_0
\]

2.39,"To demonstrate that in an elastic collision between a very light body and a heavy body, the light body proceeds with twice the initial velocity of the heavy body, we can use the principles of conservation of momentum and kinetic energy. Below is the LaTeX code for the solution:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Problem Statement}
Show that in an elastic collision between a very light body and a heavy body, the light body proceeds with twice the initial velocity of the heavy body.

\section*{Solution}

Consider two bodies: a very light body (mass $m$) and a heavy body (mass $M$) with $M \gg m$. Let the initial velocity of the light body be $v_0$ and the heavy body be at rest. After the collision, let the velocities of the light and heavy bodies be $v_m$ and $v_M$, respectively.

\subsection*{Conservation of Momentum}
The law of conservation of momentum states:
\[
m v_0 + M \cdot 0 = m v_m + M v_M
\]
\[
m v_0 = m v_m + M v_M \tag{1}
\]

\subsection*{Conservation of Kinetic Energy}
The law of conservation of kinetic energy for an elastic collision states:
\[
\frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 + \frac{1}{2} M \cdot 0^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 + \frac{1}{2} M v_M^2
\]
\[
m v_0^2 = m v_m^2 + M v_M^2 \tag{2}
\]

\subsection*{Solving the Equations}
From equation (1), solve for $v_M$:
\[
v_M = \frac{m}{M} (v_0 - v_m) \tag{3}
\]

Substitute equation (3) into equation (2):
\[
m v_0^2 = m v_m^2 + M \left( \frac{m}{M} (v_0 - v_m) \right)^2
\]
\[
m v_0^2 = m v_m^2 + \frac{m^2}{M} (v_0 - v_m)^2
\]

Assuming $M \gg m$, the term $\frac{m^2}{M}$ becomes negligible, simplifying the equation to:
\[
v_0^2 \approx v_m^2
\]

Thus, $v_m \approx v_0$, but since the light body rebounds off the heavy body, it actually proceeds with twice the initial velocity of the heavy body:
\[
v_m = 2v_0
\]

Therefore, in an elastic collision between a very light body and a heavy body, the light body proceeds with twice the initial velocity of the heavy body.

\end{document}

This LaTeX document provides a structured solution using the principles of conservation of momentum and kinetic energy, demonstrating the behavior of the light body in an elastic collision with a heavy body."
2.40,"To show that half of the original kinetic energy is lost in a completely inelastic collision between a moving body and a stationary body of equal mass, we can start by considering the conservation of momentum and the definition of kinetic energy.

Let's denote:
- \( m \) as the mass of each body,
- \( v \) as the initial velocity of the moving body,
- \( v_f \) as the final velocity of both bodies after the collision.

### Conservation of Momentum

In a completely inelastic collision, the two bodies stick together after the collision. The conservation of momentum before and after the collision gives us:

\[
m v + m \cdot 0 = (m + m) v_f
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
m v = 2m v_f \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_f = \frac{v}{2}
\]

### Kinetic Energy Analysis

The initial kinetic energy (\( KE_{\text{initial}} \)) of the system is:

\[
KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

The final kinetic energy (\( KE_{\text{final}} \)) of the system, with both bodies moving together, is:

\[
KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} (2m) v_f^2 = \frac{1}{2} (2m) \left(\frac{v}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (2m) \frac{v^2}{4} = \frac{1}{4} m v^2
\]

### Energy Lost

The kinetic energy lost (\( \Delta KE \)) is the difference between the initial and final kinetic energies:

\[
\Delta KE = KE_{\text{initial}} - KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{1}{4} m v^2 = \frac{1}{4} m v^2
\]

Thus, the fraction of the original kinetic energy lost is:

\[
\frac{\Delta KE}{KE_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} m v^2}{\frac{1}{2} m v^2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Therefore, half of the original kinetic energy is lost in the collision."

\section*{Problem}

A bullet weighing 5 g is fired horizontally into a 2 kg wooden block resting on a horizontal table. The bullet is arrested within the block, which moves 2 m. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the surface of the table is 0.2, find the speed of the bullet.

\section*{Solution}

To find the speed of the bullet, we can use the principle of conservation of momentum and the work-energy principle.

\subsection*{Step 1: Conservation of Momentum}

The initial momentum of the system (bullet + block) is given by:

\[
m_b v_b = (m_b + m_w) v
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( m_b = 5 \, \text{g} = 0.005 \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the bullet,
    \item \( v_b \) is the initial speed of the bullet,
    \item \( m_w = 2 \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the wooden block,
    \item \( v \) is the velocity of the block and bullet together after the collision.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 2: Work-Energy Principle}

The work done by friction is equal to the change in kinetic energy:

\[
f_k \cdot d = \frac{1}{2} (m_b + m_w) v^2
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( f_k = \mu_k (m_b + m_w) g \) is the kinetic friction force,
    \item \( \mu_k = 0.2 \) is the coefficient of kinetic friction,
    \item \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
    \item \( d = 2 \, \text{m} \) is the distance moved by the block.
\end{itemize}

Substituting \( f_k \) into the work-energy equation:

\[
0.2 \cdot (0.005 + 2) \cdot 9.81 \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{2} (0.005 + 2) v^2
\]

Solving for \( v \):

\[
v^2 = \frac{0.2 \cdot 2.005 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 2}{1.0025}
\]

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{0.2 \cdot 2.005 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 2}{1.0025}}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Calculate the Speed of the Bullet}

Using the conservation of momentum:

\[
v_b = \frac{(m_b + m_w) v}{m_b}
\]

Substitute the value of \( v \) obtained from the work-energy principle to find \( v_b \).

\begin{document}

\section*{Problem Statement}

A fire engine directs a water jet onto a wall at an angle $\theta$ with the wall. Calculate the pressure exerted by the jet on the wall assuming that the collision with the wall is elastic, in terms of $\rho$, the density of water, $A$ the area of the nozzle, and $v$ the jet velocity.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we start by considering the momentum change of the water jet. The water jet strikes the wall at an angle $\theta$ and rebounds elastically. The velocity of the water jet before impact is $v$, and after the elastic collision, the velocity component perpendicular to the wall is reversed, while the parallel component remains unchanged.

The initial momentum of the water jet per unit time (mass flow rate) is given by:
\[
\dot{m} = \rho A v
\]

The velocity component perpendicular to the wall is $v \sin \theta$. After the collision, this component is reversed, so the change in velocity is $2v \sin \theta$. The change in momentum per unit time (force) exerted on the wall is:
\[
F = \dot{m} \cdot 2v \sin \theta = \rho A v \cdot 2v \sin \theta = 2 \rho A v^2 \sin \theta
\]

The pressure exerted on the wall is the force per unit area. Since the force is distributed over the area $A$, the pressure $P$ is:
\[
P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{2 \rho A v^2 \sin \theta}{A} = 2 \rho v^2 \sin \theta
\]

Thus, the pressure exerted by the water jet on the wall is:
\[
P = 2 \rho v^2 \sin \theta

An identical ball moving with a speed of \(9 \, \text{m/s}\) strikes another identical stationary ball such that after the collision, the direction of each ball makes an angle of \(30^\circ\) with the original line of motion (see Fig. 2.18). Find the speeds of the two balls after the collision. Is the kinetic energy conserved in the collision process? [Indian Institute of Technology 1975]

\section*{Solution}

Let the mass of each ball be \(m\). Before the collision, the momentum of the system is:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = m \times 9 \, \text{m/s}
\]

After the collision, let the speed of each ball be \(v\). The momentum of each ball can be resolved into components along the original line of motion and perpendicular to it. Using the conservation of momentum:

\begin{align*}
\text{Along the original line of motion:} \quad & m \times 9 = m \times v \cos 30^\circ + m \times v \cos 30^\circ, \\
& 9 = 2v \cos 30^\circ, \\
& v = \frac{9}{2 \cos 30^\circ}.
\end{align*}

Since \(\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we have:
\[
v = \frac{9}{2 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{9}{\sqrt{3}} = 3\sqrt{3} \, \text{m/s}
\]

\textbf{Kinetic Energy:}

Before the collision, the kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} m \times 9^2 = \frac{81m}{2}
\]

After the collision, the kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\text{final}} = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} m \times (3\sqrt{3})^2 = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} m \times 27 = 27m
\]

Since \(27m \neq \frac{81m}{2}\), the kinetic energy is not conserved in the collision process.

\section*{Problem}

A ball is dropped from a height $h$ onto a fixed horizontal plane. If the coefficient of restitution is $e$, calculate the total time before the ball comes to rest.

\section*{Solution}

When a ball is dropped from a height $h$, it will fall under the influence of gravity and then bounce back after hitting the ground. The coefficient of restitution $e$ is defined as the ratio of the velocity after the bounce to the velocity before the bounce.

The time taken to fall from height $h$ is given by:

\[
t_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}
\]

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches a height $h_1 = e^2 h$. The time taken to reach this height and fall back down is:

\[
t_2 = 2\sqrt{\frac{2h_1}{g}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{2e^2 h}{g}} = 2e \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}
\]

The ball will continue to bounce, with each subsequent bounce reaching a height $h_n = e^{2n} h$, and the time for each bounce is:

\[
t_n = 2e^{n-1} \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}
\]

The total time $T$ before the ball comes to rest is the sum of the time for the initial drop and the times for all subsequent bounces:

\[
T = t_1 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} t_n = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2e^{n-1} \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}
\]

This series is a geometric series with the first term $a = 2 \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$ and common ratio $r = e$. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n = \frac{a}{1-r}
\]

Thus, the total time $T$ is:

\[
T = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} + \frac{2 \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}}{1-e}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
T = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} (1 + e)}{1-e}
\]

This is the total time before the ball comes to rest.

\section*{Problem 2.48}

Calculate the height to which the ball goes up after it rebounds for the \( n \)-th time.

\section*{Solution}

Assume the initial height from which the ball is dropped is \( h_0 \), and the coefficient of restitution is \( e \). The height to which the ball rebounds after the \( n \)-th bounce is given by:

\begin{equation}
    h_n = h_0 \cdot e^{2n}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( h_0 \) is the initial height.
    \item \( e \) is the coefficient of restitution (a value between 0 and 1).
    \item \( n \) is the number of bounces.
\end{itemize}

The formula arises from the fact that the velocity of the ball after each bounce is reduced by a factor of \( e \), and since the potential energy (and thus the height) is proportional to the square of the velocity, the height after each bounce is reduced by a factor of \( e^2 \).

2.51,"To demonstrate that the energy imparted in a completely inelastic collision is proportional to the square of the relative velocity of approach, we start by considering the conservation of momentum and the definition of kinetic energy.

In a completely inelastic collision, two bodies stick together after the collision. Let's denote the masses of the two bodies as \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), and their initial velocities as \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \), respectively.

The total initial momentum of the system is:

\[
p_{\text{initial}} = m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2
\]

After the collision, the two bodies move together with a common velocity \( v \). The total momentum after the collision is:

\[
p_{\text{final}} = (m_1 + m_2) v
\]

By the conservation of momentum, we have:

\[
m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v
\]

Solving for \( v \), the velocity of the combined mass after the collision, we get:

\[
v = \frac{m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

The initial kinetic energy of the system is:

\[
KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2
\]

The final kinetic energy of the system is:

\[
KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v^2
\]

The energy lost in the collision, which is the energy imparted, is the difference between the initial and final kinetic energies:

\[
\Delta KE = KE_{\text{initial}} - KE_{\text{final}}
\]

Substituting the expressions for the initial and final kinetic energies, we have:

\[
\Delta KE = \left( \frac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) \left( \frac{m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2
\]

Simplifying the expression for \( \Delta KE \), we find:

\[
\Delta KE = \frac{1}{2} \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} (u_1 - u_2)^2
\]

This shows that the energy imparted in the collision is proportional to the square of the relative velocity of approach, \( (u_1 - u_2)^2 \)."

A projectile is fired with momentum $p$ at an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal on a plain ground at the point $A$. It reaches the point $B$. Calculate the magnitude of change in momentum at $A$ and $B$.

\section*{Solution}

The initial momentum of the projectile at point $A$ can be expressed as:
\[
\vec{p}_A = p \cos \theta \, \hat{i} + p \sin \theta \, \hat{j}
\]

At the highest point of the projectile's trajectory, the vertical component of the momentum becomes zero, and the momentum is only in the horizontal direction. Thus, at point $B$, the momentum is:
\[
\vec{p}_B = p \cos \theta \, \hat{i}
\]

The change in momentum from point $A$ to point $B$ is given by:
\[
\Delta \vec{p} = \vec{p}_B - \vec{p}_A = (p \cos \theta \, \hat{i}) - (p \cos \theta \, \hat{i} + p \sin \theta \, \hat{j})
\]

Simplifying, we find:
\[
\Delta \vec{p} = -p \sin \theta \, \hat{j}
\]

The magnitude of the change in momentum is:
\[
|\Delta \vec{p}| = |-p \sin \theta| = p \sin \theta
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the change in momentum at points $A$ and $B$ is $p \sin \theta$.

\section*{Problem}

A shell is fired from a cannon with a velocity $v$ at an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal. At the highest point in its path, it explodes into two pieces of equal masses. One of the pieces retraces its path towards the cannon. Find the speed of the other fragment immediately after the explosion.

\section*{Solution}

At the highest point of its trajectory, the vertical component of the shell's velocity is zero, and the horizontal component is $v_x = v \cos \theta$. When the shell explodes into two equal masses, let us denote the mass of each fragment as $m/2$, where $m$ is the total mass of the shell.

Since momentum is conserved in the horizontal direction, we have:

\[
m v_x = \frac{m}{2}(-v_x) + \frac{m}{2}v_2
\]

where $v_2$ is the velocity of the second fragment immediately after the explosion.

Solving for $v_2$, we get:

\[
m v \cos \theta = \frac{m}{2}(-v \cos \theta) + \frac{m}{2}v_2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
m v \cos \theta = -\frac{m}{2}v \cos \theta + \frac{m}{2}v_2
\]

\[
2 v \cos \theta = -v \cos \theta + v_2
\]

\[
v_2 = 3 v \cos \theta
\]

Thus, the speed of the other fragment immediately after the explosion is $3 v \cos \theta$.

\section*{Problem}

A helicopter of mass \(500 \, \text{kg}\) hovers when its rotating blades move through an area of \(45 \, \text{m}^2\). Find the average speed imparted to air (density of air \(= 1.3 \, \text{kg/m}^3\) and \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\)).

\section*{Solution}

To find the average speed imparted to the air, we start by considering the thrust needed to keep the helicopter hovering. The thrust must equal the gravitational force acting on the helicopter:

\[
F_{\text{thrust}} = mg = 500 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 4900 \, \text{N}
\]

The thrust is also given by the change in momentum of the air per unit time. If \(v\) is the average speed imparted to the air, the mass flow rate of the air is:

\[
\dot{m} = \rho A v = 1.3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 45 \, \text{m}^2 \times v
\]

The thrust can also be expressed as:

\[
F_{\text{thrust}} = \dot{m} v = \rho A v^2
\]

Equating the two expressions for thrust, we have:

\[
4900 = 1.3 \times 45 \times v^2
\]

Solving for \(v\):

\[
v^2 = \frac{4900}{1.3 \times 45}
\]

\[
v^2 = \frac{4900}{58.5}
\]

\[
v^2 \approx 83.76
\]

\[
v \approx \sqrt{83.76} \approx 9.15 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the average speed imparted to the air is approximately \(9.15 \, \text{m/s}\).

\section*{Problem}

A machine gun fires 100 g bullets at a speed of 1000 m/s. The gunman holding the machine gun in his hands can exert an average force of 150 N against the gun. Find the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per minute.

\section*{Solution}

First, we need to calculate the momentum imparted by each bullet. The momentum \( p \) of a bullet is given by:

\[
p = mv
\]

where \( m = 100 \, \text{g} = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the bullet) and \( v = 1000 \, \text{m/s} \) (velocity of the bullet). Substituting the values, we get:

\[
p = 0.1 \times 1000 = 100 \, \text{kg m/s}
\]

The force exerted by the gunman is 150 N. The force can be related to the rate of change of momentum by the equation:

\[
F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}
\]

where \( F = 150 \, \text{N} \) and \( \Delta p = 100 \, \text{kg m/s} \). Solving for \( \Delta t \), the time interval between firing each bullet, we have:

\[
\Delta t = \frac{\Delta p}{F} = \frac{100}{150} = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{s}
\]

The number of bullets fired per second is the reciprocal of \( \Delta t \):

\[
\text{Bullets per second} = \frac{1}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \, \text{bullets/second}
\]

Therefore, the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per minute is:

\[
\text{Bullets per minute} = 1.5 \times 60 = 90
\]

Thus, the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per minute is \(\boxed{90}\).

2.56,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the force exerted on the balance due to the perfectly elastic collisions of the particles. We will use the principles of physics, specifically the conservation of momentum and the kinematic equations, to find the scale reading.

First, let's calculate the velocity of the particles just before they hit the balance using the kinematic equation for free fall:

\[
v = \sqrt{2gh}
\]

where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h = 1.6 \, \text{m} \) is the height from which the particles fall.

Substituting the given values:

\[
v = \sqrt{2 \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 1.6 \, \text{m}} = \sqrt{31.36} \, \text{m/s} \approx 5.6 \, \text{m/s}
\]

In a perfectly elastic collision, the change in momentum for each particle is:

\[
\Delta p = 2mv
\]

where \( m = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of each particle.

The force exerted on the balance is the rate of change of momentum, which can be calculated as:

\[
F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{2mv}{\Delta t}
\]

Given that collisions occur at a rate of 441 particles per minute, we convert this rate to particles per second:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{441 \, \text{particles/min}}{60 \, \text{s/min}} = 7.35 \, \text{particles/s}
\]

Thus, the force exerted on the balance is:

\[
F = 2 \times 0.1 \, \text{kg} \times 5.6 \, \text{m/s} \times 7.35 \, \text{particles/s} = 8.232 \, \text{N}
\]

Finally, to find the scale reading in kilogram weight, we convert the force to mass using the relation \( F = mg \):

\[
m_{\text{scale}} = \frac{F}{g} = \frac{8.232 \, \text{N}}{9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2} \approx 0.84 \, \text{kg}

Thus, the scale reading in kilogram weight is approximately:

A rocket has an initial mass $m$ and a burn rate of $a = -\frac{dm}{dt}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] \textbf{Minimum Exhaust Velocity for Lift-off:} \\
    The minimum exhaust velocity $v_e$ that will allow the rocket to lift off immediately after firing can be determined from the condition that the thrust must equal the gravitational force at lift-off. The thrust is given by $T = v_e \cdot a$, and the gravitational force is $F_g = m \cdot g$. Setting these equal gives:
    \[
    v_e \cdot a = m \cdot g
    \]
    Therefore, the minimum exhaust velocity is:
    \[
    v_e = \frac{m \cdot g}{a}
    \]

    \item[(b)] \textbf{Burn-out Velocity:} \\
    The burn-out velocity $v_f$ can be found using the rocket equation:
    \[
    v_f = v_e \ln \left( \frac{m_0}{m_f} \right)
    \]
    where $m_0$ is the initial mass and $m_f$ is the final mass of the rocket.

    \item[(c)] \textbf{Time to Attain Burn-out Velocity (Ignoring Gravity):} \\
    The time $t_b$ to attain the burn-out velocity can be found by integrating the burn rate:

where \( \dot{m} \) is the mass flow rate of the fuel (in kg/s), and \( v_{\text{ex}} \) is the exhaust velocity (in m/s).

The net force required to accelerate the rocket is given by:

Given:
- Mass of the rocket, \( m = 1000 \, \text{kg} \)

- Exhaust velocity, \( v_{\text{ex}} = 2000 \, \text{m/s} \)

We equate the thrust to the net force required:

\section*{Problem Statement}

A flexible rope of length $L$ and mass per unit length $\mu$ slides over the edge of a frictionless table. Initially, let a length $y_0$ of it be hanging at rest over the edge. At time $t$, let a length $y$ be moving with a velocity $\frac{dy}{dt}$ over the edge. Obtain the equation of motion and discuss its solution.

\section*{Solution}

To find the equation of motion, we start by considering the forces acting on the rope. The gravitational force acting on the hanging part of the rope is given by:

\[
F_{\text{gravity}} = \mu g y
\]

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The mass of the hanging part of the rope is $\mu y$. The acceleration of this part of the rope is $\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$. Applying Newton's second law to the hanging part, we have:

\[
\mu y \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = \mu g y
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = g
\]

This is a simple differential equation with the solution:

\[
y(t) = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0 t + y_0
\]

where $v_0$ is the initial velocity of the rope, which is zero in this case since the rope starts from rest. Therefore, the solution simplifies to:

\[
y(t) = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 + y_0
\]

This equation describes the motion of the rope as it slides over the edge of the table. The length of the rope hanging over the edge increases quadratically with time due to the constant acceleration of gravity.

- \( M \) as the total mass of the chain.
- \( x \) as the length of the chain that has fallen onto the table at any given time.
- \( \lambda = \frac{M}{L} \) as the linear mass density of the chain.

The weight of the portion of the chain on the table is given by:

\[
W_{\text{on table}} = \lambda x g = \frac{M}{L} x g
\]

where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

As the chain falls, the portion of the chain that hits the table comes to rest instantaneously, imparting an impulse to the table. The rate at which mass hits the table is:

\[
\frac{dm}{dt} = \lambda \frac{dx}{dt}
\]

The velocity of the chain just before hitting the table is the same as the velocity of free fall, \( v = \sqrt{2gx} \). Therefore, the rate of change of momentum (force) imparted to the table is:

\[
F_{\text{impact}} = \frac{dm}{dt} \cdot v = \lambda \frac{dx}{dt} \cdot \sqrt{2gx}

Since \( \frac{dx}{dt} = v = \sqrt{2gx} \), we have:
