\section*{Physics Problem: Motion of Truck and Car}

\subsection*{(a) Equations of Motion}

The equation of motion for the truck is given by:
\begin{equation}
    s = ut \tag{1}
\end{equation}

The equation of motion for the car is given by:
\begin{equation}
    s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \tag{2}
\end{equation}

The graphs for equations (1) and (2) are shown in Fig. 1.13. By eliminating \( t \) between the two equations, we have:
\begin{equation}
    s \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{as}{u^2} \right) = 0 \tag{3}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Fig. 1.13} shows the graphical representation of these equations. The solutions are either \( s = 0 \) or \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{as}{u^2} = 0 \).

The first solution corresponds to the result that the truck overtakes the car at \( s = 0 \) and therefore at \( t = 0 \).

The second solution gives:
\[
s = \frac{2u^2}{a} = \frac{2 \times 10^2}{2} = 100 \, \text{m}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Time Calculation}

The time \( t \) when the truck overtakes the car is given by:
\[
t = \frac{s}{u} = \frac{100}{10} = 10 \, \text{s}
\]

\subsection*{(c) Final Velocity of the Car}

The final velocity \( v \) of the car is:
\[
v = at = 2 \times 10 = 20 \, \text{m/s}
\]

When the stone reaches a height $h$ above $A$, we have:

\begin{equation}
v_1^2 = u^2 - 2gh \tag{1}
\end{equation}

and when it reaches a distance $h$ below $A$, we have:

\begin{equation}
v_2^2 = u^2 + 2gh \tag{2}
\end{equation}

since the velocity of the stone while crossing $A$ on its return journey is again $u$ vertically down. Also, it is given that:

\begin{equation}
v_2 = 2v_1 \tag{3}
\end{equation}

Combining equations (1), (2), and (3), we get:

\begin{equation}
u^2 = \frac{10}{3} gh \tag{4}

The maximum height $H$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
H = \frac{u^2}{2g} = \frac{\frac{10}{3} gh}{2g} = \frac{5h}{3}

Let the stones meet at a height $s$ from the earth after time $t$. 

The distance covered by the first stone is given by:
\begin{equation}
    h - s = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\end{equation}
where $h = 19.6 \, \text{m}$.

For the second stone:
\begin{equation}
    s = ut = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\end{equation}

The velocity equation is:
\begin{equation}
    v^2 = 0 = u^2 - 2gh
\end{equation}
Solving for $u$, we have:
\begin{equation}
    u = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.8 \times 19.6} = 19.6 \, \text{m/s}

Adding equations (1) and (2), we get:
\begin{equation}
    h = ut, \quad t = \frac{h}{u} = \frac{19.6}{19.6} = 1 \, \text{s}

The displacement of a particle undergoing simple harmonic motion can be expressed as:

Let the lamp be at point \( A \) at height \( H \) from the ground, i.e., \( AB = H \), as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lamp_shadow}. Let the man be initially at \( B \), directly below the lamp, with his height being \( BD = h \), so that the tip of his shadow is at \( B \).

The man walks from \( B \) to \( F \) in time \( t \) with speed \( v \), and the shadow moves out to \( C \) in the same time \( t \) with speed \( v' \). From the figure, we have:
\[
BF = vt, \quad BC = v't
\]

From the similar triangles \( \triangle EFC \) and \( \triangle ABC \), we have:
\[
\frac{FC}{BC} = \frac{EF}{AB} = \frac{h}{H}
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( FC \) and \( BC \):
\[
\frac{v't - vt}{v't} = \frac{h}{H}
\]

Solving for \( v' \):
\[
v' = \frac{Hv}{H - h}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
v' = \frac{6 \times 7}{6 - 1.8} = 10 \, \text{m/s}

Thus, the speed of the shadow is \( 10 \, \text{m/s} \).

Given \( h = 44.1 \, \text{m} \), \( t_2 = 2.0 \, \text{s} \), and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), we find the initial velocity \( u \) as follows:

Now, consider:

In 2 seconds after the truck driver applies the brakes, the distance of separation between the truck and the car becomes:

The velocity of the truck becomes:

\[
v_{\text{truck}} = 20 - 2 \times 2 = 16 \, \text{m/s}

Thus, at this moment, the relative velocity between the car and the truck will be:

\[
u_{\text{rel}} = 20 - 16 = 4 \, \text{m/s}

Let the car decelerate at a constant rate of \( a_2 \). Then the relative deceleration will be:

\[
a_{\text{rel}} = a_2 - a_1
\]

If the rear-end collision is to be avoided, the car and the truck must have the same final velocity, that is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0 \). Now:

From Fig. 1.17a, we have:

\[

\]

The direction of \( \mathbf{v}_{BA} \) can be found using the law of sines for \(\triangle ABC\), as shown in Fig. 1.17a:

\[
\frac{AC}{\sin \theta} = \frac{BC}{\sin 60^\circ} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sin \theta = \frac{AC}{BC} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{v_B}{v_{BA}} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{20 \times 0.866}{10\sqrt{7}} = 0.6546
\]

Thus, 

\[
\theta = 40.9^\circ
\]

Therefore, \( \mathbf{v}_{BA} \) makes an angle of \( 40.9^\circ \) east of north.

For part (ii), let the distance between the two ships be \( r \) at time \( t \). From the construction of Fig. 1.17b, we have:

\[
r = \left[ (v_A t - v_B t \cos 60^\circ)^2 + (10 - v_B t \sin 60^\circ)^2 \right]^{1/2}

The distance of closest approach can be found by setting \(\frac{dr}{dt} = 0\). This gives:

\[
t = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{7} \, \text{h}

When \( t = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{7} \) is inserted into equation (1), we get:

The initial velocity of the packet is the same as that of the balloon and is pointing upwards, which is taken as the positive direction. The acceleration due to gravity being in the opposite direction is taken as negative. The displacement is also negative since it is vertically downwards:

\begin{align*}
    u &= 9.8 \, \text{m/s}, \\
    a &= -g = -9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2, \\
    S &= -98 \, \text{m}.

Using the equation of motion:

\[
S = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
-98 = 9.8t + \frac{1}{2} \times (-9.8) t^2
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
-98 = 9.8t - 4.9t^2
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
4.9t^2 - 9.8t - 98 = 0
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 4.9:

\[
t^2 - 2t - 20 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = -20 \). Substituting these values:

\[
t = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-20)}}{2 \times 1}

\[
t = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 80}}{2}

\[
t = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{84}}{2}

\[
t = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 \times 21}}{2}

\[
t = \frac{2 \pm 2\sqrt{21}}{2}

\[
t = 1 \pm \sqrt{21}

The acceptable solution is:

\[

Physically, the difference between $t_1$ and $t_2$ on the one hand, and $v$ and $u$ on the other hand, arises due to the fact that during ascent both gravity and air resistance act downward (friction acts opposite to motion), but during descent gravity and air resistance are oppositely directed. Air resistance $F$ actually increases with the velocity of the object ($F \propto v$, $v^2$, or $v^3$). Here, for simplicity, we assume it to be constant.

For upward motion, the equation of motion is 
\begin{equation}
    ma_1 = -(F + mg) \quad \text{or} \quad a_1 = -\left(\frac{F}{m} + g\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation}

For downward motion, the equation of motion is 
\begin{equation}
    ma_2 = mg - F \quad \text{or} \quad a_2 = g - \frac{F}{m} \tag{2}
\end{equation}

For ascent:
\begin{align}
    v_1 &= 0 = u + a_1 t = u - \left(\frac{F}{m} + g\right) t_1 \\
    t_1 &= \frac{u}{g + \frac{F}{m}} \tag{3}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    v_1^2 &= 0 = u^2 + 2a_1 h \\
    u &= \sqrt{2h\left(g + \frac{F}{m}\right)} \tag{4}
\end{align}

where we have used (1). Using (4) in (3),
\begin{equation}
    t_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g + \frac{F}{m}}} \tag{5}
\end{equation}

For descent:
\begin{align}
    v_2 &= \sqrt{2a_2 h} \\
    v &= \sqrt{2h \left(g - \frac{F}{m}\right)} \tag{6}
\end{align}

where we have used (2). 
\begin{equation}
    t_2 = \frac{v}{a_2} = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g - \frac{F}{m}}} \tag{7}
\end{equation}

where we have used (2) and (6). From (5) and (7),
\begin{equation}
    \frac{t_2}{t_1} = \sqrt{\frac{g + \frac{F}{m}}{g - \frac{F}{m}}} \tag{8}
\end{equation}

It follows that $t_2 > t_1$, that is, the time of descent is greater than the time of ascent. Further, from (4) and (6),
\begin{equation}
    \frac{v}{u} = \sqrt{\frac{g - \frac{F}{m}}{g + \frac{F}{m}}} \tag{9}
\end{equation}

It follows that $v < u$, that is, the final speed is smaller than the initial speed.

Taking the downward direction as positive, the equation of motion is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dv}{dt} = g - kv \tag{1}
\end{equation}

where \( k \) is a constant. Integrating both sides, we have:

\[
\int \frac{dv}{g-kv} = \int dt
\]

This leads to:

\[
-\frac{1}{k} \ln \left( \frac{g-kv}{c} \right) = t
\]

where \( c \) is a constant. Solving for \( v \), we get:

\begin{equation}
    g - kv = c e^{-kt} \tag{2}
\end{equation}

This gives the velocity at any instant. As \( t \) increases, \( e^{-kt} \) decreases, and if \( t \) increases indefinitely, \( g - kv = 0 \), i.e.,

\begin{equation}
    v = \frac{g}{k} \tag{3}
\end{equation}

This limiting velocity is called the terminal velocity. We can obtain an expression for the distance \( x \) traversed in time \( t \). First, we identify the constant \( c \) in equation (2). Since it is assumed that \( v = 0 \) at \( t = 0 \), it follows that \( c = g \).

Writing \( v = \frac{dx}{dt} \) in equation (2) and substituting \( c = g \), we integrate:

\[
g - k \frac{dx}{dt} = g e^{-kt}
\]

Integrating both sides:

\[
\int g \, dt - k \int dx = g \int e^{-kt} \, dt + D
\]

Solving the integrals, we have:

\[
gt - kx = -\frac{g}{k} e^{-kt} + D
\]

At \( x = 0, t = 0 \); therefore, \( D = \frac{g}{k} \). Thus, the expression for \( x \) is:

\begin{equation}
    x = \frac{gt}{k} - \frac{g}{k^2} \left( 1 - e^{-kt} \right) \tag{4}

Measuring $x$ upward, the equation of motion will be
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -g - k \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2
\end{equation}

We have
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt} \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right) = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{dv}{dx} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt} = v \frac{dv}{dx}
\end{equation}

Thus,
\begin{equation}
    v \frac{dv}{dx} = -g - kv^2
\end{equation}

Integrating, we have
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2k} \int \frac{d(v^2)}{(g/k) + v^2} = - \int dx
\end{equation}

Integrating, we obtain
\begin{equation}
    \ln \left(\frac{g/k + v^2}{c}\right) = -2kx \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{g}{k} + v^2 = c e^{-2kx}
\end{equation}

When $x = 0$, $v = u$; thus, $c = \frac{g}{k} + u^2$ and writing $\frac{g}{k} = V^2$, we have
\begin{equation}
    \frac{V^2 + v^2}{V^2 + u^2} = e^{-2gx/V^2}
\end{equation}

Therefore,
\begin{equation}
    v^2 = (V^2 + u^2) e^{-2gx/V^2} - V^2
\end{equation}

The height $h$ to which the particle rises is found by putting $v = 0$ at $x = h$ in (5):
\begin{equation}
    \frac{V^2 + u^2}{V^2} = e^{2gh/V^2}

The velocity at any point during the descent is given by 
\[
v^2 = V^2 \left( 1 - e^{-\frac{2gx}{V^2}} \right) \quad \text{(by prob. 1.23)}

The velocity of the body when it reaches the point of projection is found by substituting \( h \) for \( x \):

\section*{Physics Problem and Solution}

Take the upward direction as positive. Referring to Fig. 1.18, at time $t$, the velocities of the objects are given by:

\begin{align}
    \mathbf{v}_1 &= u_1 \hat{\imath} - gt \hat{\jmath} \label{eq:v1} \\
    \mathbf{v}_2 &= -u_2 \hat{\imath} - gt \hat{\jmath} \label{eq:v2}
\end{align}

If $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ are to be perpendicular to each other, then $\mathbf{v}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_2 = 0$. Therefore, we have:

\begin{align*}
    (u_1 \hat{\imath} - gt \hat{\jmath}) \cdot (-u_2 \hat{\imath} - gt \hat{\jmath}) &= 0 \\
    \Rightarrow -u_1 u_2 + g^2 t^2 &= 0 \\
    \Rightarrow t &= \frac{1}{g} \sqrt{u_1 u_2} \tag{3}

The position vectors are:

The distance of separation of the objects will be:

Consider the equation for the displacement:

Let the two roots be \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \). Compare equation (2) with the quadratic equation:

The product of the two roots is equal to \( \frac{c}{a} \). It follows that:

Thus, the geometric mean of the roots is:

\section*{Resolution of Forces into Components}

\subsection*{Force Components}

Resolve the force into \( x \)- and \( y \)-components:

\[
F_x = -80 \cos 35^\circ + 60 + 40 \cos 45^\circ = 22.75 \, \text{N}
\]

\[
F_y = 80 \sin 35^\circ + 0 - 40 \sin 45^\circ = 17.6 \, \text{N}
\]

\subsection*{Net Force}

(i) Calculate the net force:

\[
F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2} = \sqrt{(22.75)^2 + (17.6)^2} = 28.76 \, \text{N}
\]

Calculate the angle \( \theta \) with respect to the \( x \)-axis:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{F_y}{F_x} = \frac{17.6}{22.75} = 0.7736 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta = 37.7^\circ
\]

The vector \( F_{\text{net}} \) makes an angle of \( 37.7^\circ \) with the \( x \)-axis.

\subsection*{Acceleration}

(ii) Calculate the acceleration \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{28.76 \, \text{N}}{3.8 \, \text{kg}} = 7.568 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

\subsection*{Opposing Force}

(iii) A force \( F_4 \) of magnitude \( 28.76 \, \text{N} \) must be applied in the opposite direction to \( F_{\text{net}} \).

\section*{Physics Problem: Force and Friction}

Consider a container subjected to an applied force and frictional force. The equations governing these forces are given below:

\begin{align*}
    \text{Applied Force:} \quad & F = ma \\
    \text{Frictional Force:} \quad & F_r = \mu mg
\end{align*}

Setting the frictional force equal to the applied force, we have:
\[
F_r = F
\]

Substituting the expressions for the forces, we get:
\[
\mu mg = ma
\]

Solving for the acceleration \(a\), we find:
\[
\mu = \frac{a}{g}
\]

Given:
\[
\mu = 1.5, \quad g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Substituting these values, the acceleration \(a\) is calculated as:
\[
a = \mu g = 1.5 \times 9.8 = 14.7 \, \text{m/s}^2

Let the \( x \)-axis lie along the diameter of the semicircle. The center of mass must lie on the \( y \)-axis perpendicular to the flat base of the semicircle and through \( O \), the center of the base, as shown in Fig. 1.25.

For continuous mass distribution, the \( y \)-coordinate of the center of mass \( y_{\text{CM}} \) is given by:
\[
y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M} \int y \, dm
\]

Let \(\sigma\) be the surface density (mass per unit area), so that the total mass \( M \) is:
\[
M = \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 \sigma
\]

In polar coordinates, the mass element \( dm \) is:
\[
dm = \sigma \, dA = \sigma \, r \, d\theta \, dr
\]
where \( dA \) is the element of area.

Let the center of mass be located at a distance \( y_{\text{CM}} \) from \( O \) along the \( y \)-axis for reasons of symmetry:
\[
y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 \sigma} \int_0^R \int_0^\pi (r \sin \theta)(\sigma \, r \, d\theta \, dr)
\]

Simplifying, we have:
\[
y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{2}{\pi R^2} \int_0^R r^2 \int_0^\pi \sin \theta \, d\theta \, dr
\]

Evaluating the integral over \(\theta\):
\[

\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{2}{\pi R^2} \cdot 2 \int_0^R r^2 \, dr

Evaluating the integral over \( r \):
\[
\int_0^R r^2 \, dr = \left[ \frac{r^3}{3} \right]_0^R = \frac{R^3}{3}

Substituting back, we find:
\[
y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{4}{3\pi} R

Therefore, the center of mass is located at a distance \( \frac{4R}{3\pi} \) from \( O \) along the \( y \)-axis.

The mass of any portion of the disc will be proportional to its surface area. The area of the original disc is $\pi R^2$, that corresponding to the hole is $\frac{1}{4} \pi R^2$, and that of the remaining portion is:

\[
\pi R^2 - \frac{1}{4} \pi R^2 = \frac{3}{4} \pi R^2.
\]

Let the centre of the original disc be at $O$, as shown in Fig. 1.10. The hole touches the circumference of the disc at $A$, with the centre of the hole being at $C$. When this hole is cut, let the centre of mass of the remaining part be at $G$, such that $OG = x$ or $AG = AO + OG = R + x$.

If we put back the cut portion of the hole and fill it up, then the centre of mass of this small disc (at $C$) and that of the remaining portion (at $G$) must be located at the centre of the original disc at $O$. Therefore, we have:

\[
AO = R = AC \frac{\pi (R^2/4)}{\pi R^2/4 + \frac{3\pi}{4} R^2} + AG \frac{3\pi}{4} R^2.

R = \frac{R}{8} + \frac{3}{4}(R + x).

r_1 = \frac{m_2 r_2}{m_1}

Substituting \( r_2 = r - r_1 \), we have:

\[
r_1 = \frac{m_2 (r - r_1)}{m_1}

Given that \( 81 m_2 = 60 R - r_1 \), we can solve for \( r_1 \):

\[

Let \( C \) be the centroid of the equilateral triangle formed by the three H atoms in the \( xy \)-plane, as shown in Fig. 1.28. The nitrogen atom \( N \) lies vertically above \( C \), along the \( z \)-axis. The distance \( r_{CN} \) between \( C \) and \( N \) is given by:

r_{CN} = \sqrt{r_{NH_3}^2 - r_{CH_3}^2}

Calculating \( r_{CN} \):

The boat has mass \( M \) and length \( L \), with its center of mass at \( C \). Let the center of mass of the boat+boy system be located at \( G \), at a distance \( x \) from the origin.

    \caption{Diagram of the boat and boy system}
    \label{fig:boat}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

The position of the center of mass \( G \) of the boat+boy system is given by:

\[
AG = x = \frac{M \cdot AC + m \cdot AB}{M + m}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
AG = \frac{100 \times 1.5 + 50 \times 3}{100 + 50} = \frac{150 + 150}{150} = \frac{300}{150} = 2 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the distance \( CG \) is:

\[
CG = AG - AC = 2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \, \text{m}
\]

When the boy reaches \( A \), due to symmetry, the center of mass of the boat+boy system would have moved to \( H \) by a distance of \( 0.5 \, \text{m} \) on the left side of \( C \).

In the absence of external forces, the center of mass should not move. Therefore, to restore the original position of the center of mass, the boat moves towards the right so that the point \( H \) is brought back to the original mark \( G \).

Since \( HG = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0 \), the boat, in the meantime, moves through \( 1.0 \, \text{m} \) toward the right.

x_{\text{CM}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i} = \frac{mL + (2m)(2L) + (3m)(3L) + \cdots + (nm)(nL)}{m + 2m + 3m + \cdots + nm}
\]

This can be simplified as:

\[
x_{\text{CM}} = \frac{(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \cdots + n^2)L}{1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n}
\]

Using the formulas for the sum of squares of natural numbers and the sum of natural numbers, we have:

\[
x_{\text{CM}} = \frac{\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}L}{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}
\]

Simplifying further, we find:

\[
x_{\text{CM}} = \frac{(2n+1)L}{3}
\]

The diagram is the same as for problem (1.44). We start with the following expressions:

\[
y = r \sin \theta
\]

\[
dA = r \, d\theta \, dr
\]

\[
dm = r \, d\theta \, dr \, \rho = r \, d\theta \, dr \, c r^2 = c r^3 \, dr \, d\theta
\]

The total mass \( M \) is given by:

\[
M = \int dm = c \int_0^R \int_0^\pi r^3 \, dr \, d\theta = \pi c \frac{R^4}{4}
\]

\begin{equation}
M = \pi c \frac{R^4}{4}
\end{equation}

The center of mass \( y_{\text{CM}} \) is calculated as follows:

\[
y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M} \int y \, dm = \frac{1}{M} \int_0^R \int_0^\pi (r \sin \theta) c r^3 \, dr \, d\theta
\]

\[
= \frac{c}{M} \int_0^R r^4 \, dr \int_0^\pi \sin \theta \, d\theta
\]

\[
= \frac{c}{M} \cdot \frac{R^5}{5} \cdot 2
\]

\[
= \frac{8a}{5\pi}

The center of mass (CM) of the two hydrogen (H) atoms will be at the midpoint joining the atoms, as shown in Fig. 1.33. The bisector of angle \( \angle \text{HOH} \) is depicted in Fig. 1.33.

\[
OG = (OH) \cos \left( \frac{105^\circ}{2} \right) = 1.77 \times 0.06088 = 1.0775 \, \text{\AA}

Let the CM of the oxygen (O) atom and the two H atoms be located at point \( C \), at a distance \( y_{\text{CM}} \) from O on the bisector of angle \( \angle \text{HOH} \).

The center of mass (CM) coordinates of three individual laminas are given as follows:
\[
\text{CM}_1 = \left( \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right), \quad \text{CM}_2 = \left( \frac{3a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right), \quad \text{CM}_3 = \left( \frac{3a}{2}, \frac{3a}{2} \right)
\]

To find the CM coordinates of the system of these three laminas, we use the formula for the center of mass of a system of particles:
\[
x_{\text{CM}} = \frac{m \cdot \frac{a}{2} + m \cdot \frac{3a}{2} + m \cdot \frac{3a}{2}}{m + m + m} = \frac{\frac{a}{2} + \frac{3a}{2} + \frac{3a}{2}}{3} = \frac{7a}{6}
\]

\[
y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{m \cdot \frac{a}{2} + m \cdot \frac{a}{2} + m \cdot \frac{3a}{2}}{m + m + m} = \frac{\frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2} + \frac{3a}{2}}{3} = \frac{5a}{6}
\]

Thus, the CM coordinates of the system are:
\[
\left( x_{\text{CM}}, y_{\text{CM}} \right) = \left( \frac{7a}{6}, \frac{5a}{6} \right)

The potential energy function is given by:
\[
U(x) = k(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x)
\]

Taking the first derivative with respect to \(x\), we have:
\[
\frac{dU(x)}{dx} = k(6x^2 - 10x + 4)
\]

Evaluating the first derivative at \(x = 1\):
\[
\left. \frac{dU(x)}{dx} \right|_{x=1} = k(6 \cdot 1^2 - 10 \cdot 1 + 4) = 0
\]
This is the condition for a maximum or minimum. For a stable equilibrium position of the particle, it should be a minimum. To verify this, we differentiate equation (2) again:

\[
\frac{d^2U(x)}{dx^2} = k(12x - 10)
\]

Evaluating the second derivative at \(x = 1\):
\[
\left. \frac{d^2U(x)}{dx^2} \right|_{x=1} = k(12 \cdot 1 - 10) = 2k
\]

This is positive because \(k\) is positive, indicating a minimum, corresponding to a stable equilibrium.

The potential energy is given by:
\begin{equation}
    U(x) = k(x^2 - 4xl)
\end{equation}

Differentiating the potential energy with respect to \(x\), we have:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dU(x)}{dx} = 2k(x - 2l)
\end{equation}

At \(x = 2l\), the derivative of the potential energy is zero:
\begin{equation}
    \left. \frac{dU(x)}{dx} \right|_{x = 2l} = 0
\end{equation}

Differentiating equation (2) again, we find:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 2k
\end{equation}

Since \(\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 2k\) is positive, it corresponds to a minimum, indicating a stable equilibrium.

The force is given by:
\begin{equation}
    F = -\frac{dU}{dx} = -2k(x - 2l)
\end{equation}

Let \(X = x - 2l\), then the acceleration \(\ddot{X}\) is:
\begin{equation}
    \ddot{X} = \frac{F}{m} = -\frac{2k}{m}X = -\omega^2 X
\end{equation}

Thus, the frequency \(f\) is:

Let \( a \) be the side of the cube and a force \( F \) be applied on the top surface of the cube, as shown in Fig. 1.34. Consider torques about the left-hand side of the edge. The condition that the cube would topple is:

The condition for sliding is:

\[
F > \mu W \tag{2}

Comparing equations (1) and (2), we conclude that the cube will topple if \(\mu > 0.5\) and will slide if \(\mu < 0.5\).

In Fig.~1.35, let the ladder \( AB \) have length \( L \), with its weight \( mg \) acting at \( G \), the center of mass (CM) of the ladder (middle point). The weight \( mg \) produces a clockwise torque \(\tau_1\) about \( B \):

\[
\tau_1 = (mg)(BD) = (mg) \left(\frac{L}{2} \cos \alpha\right) = \frac{mgL}{2} \cos \alpha \tag{1}
\]

The friction with the ground, which acts toward the right, produces a counterclockwise torque \(\tau_2\):

\[
\tau_2 = (\mu mg)AC = \mu mg \left(\frac{L}{2} \sin \alpha\right) = \mu mg L \sin \alpha \tag{2}
\]

For limiting equilibrium \(\tau_1 = \tau_2\):

\[
\frac{mgL}{2} \cos \alpha = \mu mg L \sin \alpha

Simplifying, we find:

\mu = \frac{1}{2} \cot \alpha
