An electromagnetic wave, propagating and linearly polarized in the $xz$-plane, is incident onto an interface between two non-conducting media as shown in Fig. 14.10. The electric fields and propagation vectors of the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves are denoted by $\mathbf{E}_I$, $\mathbf{E}_R$, $\mathbf{E}_T$, $\mathbf{k}_I$, $\mathbf{k}_R$, and $\mathbf{k}_T$ respectively. The wave is incident onto the interface at the origin and makes an angle $\theta$ to the normal. Both incident and reflected waves propagate in the medium with refractive index $n_1$. The transmitted wave propagates in the medium with refractive index $n_2$ at refraction angle $\phi$. Use the boundary conditions satisfied by the electric field at the interface to show that the reflectance, $R$, is given by

\begin{equation}
R = \left( \frac{n_2 \cos \theta - n_1 \cos \phi}{n_2 \cos \theta + n_1 \cos \phi} \right)^2
\end{equation}

\textbf{14.81 (a)} Using the expressions for $R$ in prob. (14.80) and Snell's law, show that the reflectance is zero when $\tan \theta = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$.

(b) Calculate this angle for electromagnetic radiation in air incident onto glass, which has a refractive index $n = 1.5$.

\textbf{14.82 (a)} For normal incidence, the reflection coefficient, $R$, at the planar surface between two dielectric media is given by

\begin{equation}
R = \left( \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \right)^2
\end{equation}

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the media. Sketch the form of $R$ against $n_1/n_2$. On the same figure, sketch the form of $T$ against $n_1/n_2$ where $T$ is the transmission coefficient. Indicate numerical values of $T$ and $R$ where appropriate.

(b) At what value of $n_1/n_2$ does $R = T$? [University of Durham 2000]

\textbf{14.83} Consider the solutions of linearly polarized harmonic plane waves

\begin{align}
\mathbf{E} &= \mathbf{E}_0 e^{i(\omega t - \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} + \phi)}, \\
\mathbf{B} &= \mathbf{B}_0 e^{i(\omega t - \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} + \phi)}
\end{align}

where $\mathbf{E}_0$ and $\mathbf{B}_0$ are constant vectors associated with maximum amplitude of oscillations. Show that (a) $\mathbf{B}$ is perpendicular to $\mathbf{E}$; (b) $\mathbf{B}$ is in phase with $\mathbf{E}$; and (c) the magnitudes of $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{E}$ are related by $B = E/c$ for free space in the SI system.

14.101,"To determine if AM radio waves can propagate in the tunnel, we need to consider the cutoff frequency for waveguide propagation. The tunnel can be modeled as a rectangular waveguide with dimensions 15 m (width) and 4 m (height).

The cutoff frequency \( f_c \) for the dominant mode (TE\(_{10}\)) in a rectangular waveguide is given by:

\[
f_c = \frac{c}{2a}
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( a \) is the width of the waveguide (15 m in this case).

Substituting the values, we find:

\[
f_c = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{2 \times 15 \, \text{m}} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{30} \, \text{Hz} = 10^7 \, \text{Hz} = 10 \, \text{MHz}
\]

AM radio frequencies range from 530 kHz to 1600 kHz, which can be converted to MHz:

- Lower frequency: \( 530 \, \text{kHz} = 0.53 \, \text{MHz} \)
- Upper frequency: \( 1600 \, \text{kHz} = 1.6 \, \text{MHz} \)

Since the cutoff frequency \( f_c = 10 \, \text{MHz} \) is higher than the highest AM frequency of \( 1.6 \, \text{MHz} \), AM radio waves cannot propagate in the tunnel. The AM frequencies are below the cutoff frequency, meaning they will be attenuated and not propagate effectively.

Thus, the answer is:

\[
\text{AM radio waves (530–1600 kHz) cannot propagate in the tunnel.}
\]"
14.102,"To calculate the least cut-off frequency for \( \text{TE}_{mn} \) waves in a rectangular waveguide, we use the formula for the cut-off frequency:

\[
f_{c} = \frac{c}{2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n}{b}\right)^2}
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum (\( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( a \) is the width of the waveguide,
- \( b \) is the height of the waveguide,
- \( m \) and \( n \) are the mode indices.

Given the dimensions of the waveguide are \( a = 5 \, \text{cm} = 0.05 \, \text{m} \) and \( b = 4 \, \text{cm} = 0.04 \, \text{m} \), we need to find the least cut-off frequency, which occurs for the lowest mode \( \text{TE}_{10} \).

Substituting \( m = 1 \), \( n = 0 \) into the formula, we get:

\[
f_{c} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{0.05}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{0}{0.04}\right)^2}
\]

\[
f_{c} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2} \times \frac{1}{0.05}
\]

\[
f_{c} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2 \times 0.05}
\]

\[
f_{c} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{0.1}
\]

\[
f_{c} = 3 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Thus, the least cut-off frequency for the \( \text{TE}_{10} \) mode is \( 3 \, \text{GHz} \)."
14.103,"To calculate the wave and group velocities of the TE\(_{01}\) wave in a rectangular waveguide, we need to use the following formulas:

1. **Wave Velocity (\(v_p\))**: 
   \[
   v_p = \frac{c}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{f_c}{f}\right)^2}}
   \]
   where \(c\) is the speed of light, \(f_c\) is the cutoff frequency, and \(f\) is the operating frequency.

2. **Group Velocity (\(v_g\))**:
   \[
   v_g = c \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{f_c}{f}\right)^2}
   \]

3. **Cutoff Frequency (\(f_c\))** for the TE\(_{mn}\) mode:
   \[
   f_c = \frac{c}{2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n}{b}\right)^2}
   \]
   where \(m\) and \(n\) are the mode indices, and \(a\) and \(b\) are the dimensions of the waveguide.

Given:
- \(a = 1 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m}\)
- \(b = 2 \, \text{cm} = 0.02 \, \text{m}\)
- Mode: TE\(_{01}\) (\(m = 0\), \(n = 1\))

Let's calculate the cutoff frequency for the TE\(_{01}\) mode:

\[
f_c = \frac{c}{2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{0}{0.01}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{0.02}\right)^2} = \frac{c}{2} \times \frac{1}{0.02} = \frac{c}{0.04}
\]

Now, substituting \(f_c\) into the expressions for \(v_p\) and \(v_g\), we get:

- **Wave Velocity (\(v_p\))**:
  \[
  v_p = \frac{c}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{c/0.04}{f}\right)^2}}
  \]

- **Group Velocity (\(v_g\))**:
  \[
  v_g = c \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{c/0.04}{f}\right)^2}
  \]

These equations give the wave and group velocities for the TE\(_{01}\) mode in a rectangular waveguide with the given dimensions. To find specific values, substitute the desired operating frequency \(f\)."

\begin{document}

\section*{Problem}

Consider a rectangular waveguide with dimensions $x = a$ and $y = b$. The TM$_{mn}$ wave travels in the $z$-direction, which is the axis of the guide. Given that the $z$-component $E_z$ satisfies the equation:

\begin{equation}
\left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} \right) E_z = \left( k^2 - \omega^2 \mu \varepsilon \right) E_z,
\end{equation}

obtain:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] The solution for $E_z$.
    \item[(b)] The cut-off frequency.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Solution for $E_z$}

The solution for $E_z$ in a rectangular waveguide can be expressed as a product of sinusoidal functions in the $x$ and $y$ directions:

\begin{equation}
E_z(x, y, z) = E_0 \sin\left(\frac{m \pi x}{a}\right) \sin\left(\frac{n \pi y}{b}\right) e^{-j \beta z},
\end{equation}

where $m$ and $n$ are integers representing the mode numbers, $E_0$ is the amplitude of the wave, and $\beta$ is the propagation constant in the $z$-direction.

\subsection*{(b) Cut-off Frequency}

The cut-off frequency $f_c$ for the TM$_{mn}$ mode is given by:

\begin{equation}
f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\left(\frac{m \pi}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n \pi}{b}\right)^2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \varepsilon}}.
\end{equation}

This frequency represents the minimum frequency at which the TM$_{mn}$ mode can propagate in the waveguide.
