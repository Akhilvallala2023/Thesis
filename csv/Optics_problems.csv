15.2,"To calculate the radiation pressure on a perfectly absorbing surface due to a light bulb radiating equally in all directions, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the intensity \( I \) of the light at the surface:**

   \[
   I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}

   \[

\section*{Radiation Pressure Calculation}

Assuming a 1000 W light bulb radiates equally in all directions, we want to calculate the radiation pressure on a perfectly absorbing surface at a distance of 2 m.

\subsection*{Step 1: Calculate the Intensity}

The intensity \( I \) of the light at a distance \( r \) from the source is given by:

\[
I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}
\]

where:
\begin{align*}
P &= 1000 \, \text{W}, \\
r &= 2 \, \text{m}.
\end{align*}

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
I = \frac{1000}{4\pi (2)^2} = \frac{1000}{16\pi} \, \text{W/m}^2
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Calculate the Radiation Pressure}

For a perfectly absorbing surface, the radiation pressure \( P_{\text{rad}} \) is given by:

\[
P_{\text{rad}} = \frac{I}{c}
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light. Thus:

\[
P_{\text{rad}} = \frac{1000}{16\pi \times 3 \times 10^8} \, \text{N/m}^2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
P_{\text{rad}} \approx 6.63 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{N/m}^2
\]

Therefore, the radiation pressure on the surface is approximately \( 6.63 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{N/m}^2 \).

\section*{Optical Path and Fermat's Principle}

\subsection*{Optical Path}
The \textit{optical path} is defined as the product of the refractive index $n$ of the medium and the geometric path length $L$ traveled by light in that medium. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
\[
\text{Optical Path} = n \cdot L
\]

\subsection*{Fermat's Principle}
Fermat's Principle states that the path taken by a ray of light between two points is the path that can be traversed in the least time. In other words, the optical path length is stationary (usually a minimum) for the actual path taken by light.

\subsection*{Derivation of Snell's Law Using Fermat's Principle}
Consider a light ray passing from a medium with refractive index $n$ to another medium with refractive index $n'$. Let the angle of incidence be $\theta_1$ and the angle of refraction be $\theta_2$.

According to Fermat's principle, the optical path length should be stationary. For a light ray traveling from point $A$ in medium $n$ to point $B$ in medium $n'$, the optical path length $S$ is given by:
\[
S = n \cdot AB + n' \cdot BC
\]

Using the geometry of the situation and applying the law of refraction, we have:
\[
AB = \frac{x}{\cos \theta_1}, \quad BC = \frac{d-x}{\cos \theta_2}
\]

Thus, the optical path length becomes:
\[
S = n \cdot \frac{x}{\cos \theta_1} + n' \cdot \frac{d-x}{\cos \theta_2}
\]

To find the stationary path, we take the derivative of $S$ with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dS}{dx} = n \cdot \frac{1}{\cos \theta_1} - n' \cdot \frac{1}{\cos \theta_2} = 0
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
n \sin \theta_1 = n' \sin \theta_2
\]

This is Snell's Law of Refraction:
\[
\frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{n'}{n}
\]

Thus, using Fermat's principle, we have derived Snell's law of refraction at the interface between two materials with refractive indices $n$ and $n'$.

\section*{Explanation of Mirage Using Optical Path}

A mirage is an optical phenomenon that occurs due to the refraction of light in layers of air with varying temperatures. This can be explained using the concept of optical path, which is the path that light takes as it travels through a medium.

Early in the morning, on a sunny day, the heat of the sun warms the surface of a long straight road. This creates a thin layer of warm air above the road surface, with cooler air above it. The refractive index of air decreases with increasing temperature, meaning that light travels faster in warmer air than in cooler air.

Consider a possible light ray path as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:mirage}. As light travels from the cooler air into the warmer air near the road surface, it bends away from the normal due to the decrease in refractive index. This bending of light, or refraction, causes the light rays to curve upwards. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{mirage_example.png}
    \caption{Illustration of light ray path in a mirage.}
    \label{fig:mirage}
\end{figure}

The observer perceives these bent light rays as coming from the ground, creating the illusion of a pool of water or a reflective surface. This is because the brain interprets light as traveling in straight lines, leading to the perception of an inverted image of the sky on the road.

Thus, the optical path of light, altered by the varying refractive indices of the air layers, results in the fascinating phenomenon of a mirage.

        \item Two narrow beams of microwave radiation are incident normal to one surface of a large wedge of chocolate as shown in Fig.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{1. Ray of Light Incident on Face \( AB \)}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Angle of incidence with the normal, \(\theta_i = 20^\circ\).
\end{itemize}

To find the angle that the ray emerging from \( AC \) makes with the ground, we need to apply Snell's Law at each interface and consider the geometry of the setup. However, without additional information or a diagram, we assume the problem involves refraction and possibly total internal reflection.

\subsection*{2(a). Critical Angle for Glass in Air}

The critical angle \(\theta_c\) can be calculated using the formula for the critical angle:
\[
\sin \theta_c = \frac{n_2}{n_1}
\]
where \( n_1 = 1.45 \) (refractive index of glass) and \( n_2 = 1 \) (refractive index of air).

Thus,
\[
\sin \theta_c = \frac{1}{1.45}
\]

Calculating \(\theta_c\):
\[
\theta_c = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{1.45}\right)
\]

\section*{Physics Problems and Solutions}

\subsection*{Problem 1: Refraction in Chocolate}

The index of refraction for chocolate relative to air for these microwaves is given as \( n = 1.2 \). We are tasked with calculating the angle \(\alpha\) between the two emerging beams, as shown in the Figure 15.8 diagram. You can assume that the chocolate does not melt because of the microwaves.

\[
\text{Index of refraction: } n = 1.2
\]

Using Snell's law, we have:

\[
n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2
\]

Assuming the incident angle \(\theta_1\) and solving for \(\theta_2\), we can find the angle \(\alpha\).

\subsection*{Problem 2: Deviation in a Prism}

Each of the angles of a prism is \(60^\circ\) and the refraction index for sodium light is \( n = 1.5 \). Sodium light is incident at the correct angle for minimum deviation. We need to calculate the deviation of that portion of the light, which finally emerges from the prism, after having suffered one internal reflection.

\[
\text{Prism angle: } A = 60^\circ
\]
\[
\text{Index of refraction: } n = 1.5
\]

The formula for minimum deviation \(\delta_m\) in a prism is given by:

\[
\delta_m = 2i - A
\]

where \( i \) is the angle of incidence. For minimum deviation, the angle of incidence \( i \) is equal to the angle of emergence. Using the relation:

\[
n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin \left(\frac{A}{2}\right)}
\]

we can solve for \( i \) and subsequently find \(\delta_m\).

\[
\sin i = n \sin \left(\frac{A}{2}\right)
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\sin i = 1.5 \sin \left(\frac{60^\circ}{2}\right) = 1.5 \sin 30^\circ = 1.5 \times 0.5 = 0.75
\]

Thus, \( i = \arcsin(0.75) \).

Finally, the deviation \(\delta_m\) is:

\[
\delta_m = 2i - 60^\circ
\]

Calculate \( i \) and \(\delta_m\) to find the deviation.

\section*{Lens Maker's Formula and Combined Focal Length of Two Lenses}

The lens maker's formula relates the focal length \( f \) of a lens to the object distance \( u \) and the image distance \( v \). It is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Sign Convention}

In the lens maker's formula, the following sign convention is used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The object distance \( u \) is positive if the object is on the same side as the incoming light (real object).
    \item The image distance \( v \) is positive if the image is on the opposite side of the lens from the object (real image).
    \item The focal length \( f \) is positive for converging lenses and negative for diverging lenses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Combined Focal Length of Two Lenses in Contact}

When two lenses with focal lengths \( f_1 \) and \( f_2 \) are brought into contact, the focal length \( f \) of the combined lens system can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Derivation}

To derive this formula, consider the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let the first lens form an image at a distance \( v_1 \) from the lens, given by the lens formula:
    \[
    \frac{1}{f_1} = \frac{1}{v_1} - \frac{1}{u}
    \]
    \item The image formed by the first lens acts as the object for the second lens. If the lenses are in contact, the object distance for the second lens is \( u_2 = -v_1 \).
    \item For the second lens, the lens formula is:
    \[
    \frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u_2}
    \]
    Substituting \( u_2 = -v_1 \), we have:
    \[
    \frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{v_1}
    \]
    \item Adding the two equations:
    \[
    \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} = \left( \frac{1}{v_1} - \frac{1}{u} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{v_1} \right)
    \]
    \item Simplifying, we get:
    \[
    \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}
    \]
    \item Therefore, the combined focal length \( f \) is given by:
    \[
    \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2}
    \]

for a thin lens.

(b) A biconvex lens of plastic of refractive index \( n = 1.2 \) is immersed in water (\( n = 1.33 \)). Would the lens act as a converging lens or diverging lens?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Derivation of the Lens Maker's Formula}

To derive the lens maker's formula, consider a thin lens with radii of curvature \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \), and refractive index \( n \). The lens maker's formula is given by:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \left( \frac{1}{r_1} - \frac{1}{r_2} \right)
\]

This formula is derived using the refraction at spherical surfaces and the assumption of a thin lens, where the thickness of the lens is negligible compared to the radii of curvature.

\subsection*{(b) Behavior of the Lens in Water}

Given:
- Refractive index of the plastic lens, \( n_{\text{lens}} = 1.2 \)
- Refractive index of water, \( n_{\text{water}} = 1.33 \)

The lens maker's formula in a medium other than air is modified to:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \left( \frac{n_{\text{lens}}}{n_{\text{water}}} - 1 \right) \left( \frac{1}{r_1} - \frac{1}{r_2} \right)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \left( \frac{1.2}{1.33} - 1 \right) \left( \frac{1}{r_1} - \frac{1}{r_2} \right)
\]

Calculating the term:

\[
\frac{1.2}{1.33} - 1 = \frac{1.2 - 1.33}{1.33} = \frac{-0.13}{1.33} < 0
\]

Since the term is negative, the lens will act as a diverging lens when immersed in water.

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Image of the First Lens}

To locate the image formed by the first lens, we use the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f_1} = \frac{1}{v_1} - \frac{1}{u_1}
\]

where \( f_1 = 10 \, \text{cm} \) is the focal length of the first lens, \( u_1 = -5 \, \text{cm} \) (object distance, taken as negative in lens convention), and \( v_1 \) is the image distance from the first lens.

Solving for \( v_1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{v_1} + \frac{1}{5}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{v_1} = \frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{10} - \frac{2}{10} = -\frac{1}{10}
\]

\[
v_1 = -10 \, \text{cm}

The image is formed 10 cm on the same side as the object, indicating a virtual image.

\subsection*{(b) Nature of the Image}

The image formed by the first lens is virtual and erect.

\subsection*{(c) Final Image for the Lens Combination}

The image formed by the first lens acts as a virtual object for the second lens. The object distance for the second lens \( u_2 \) is:

\[
u_2 = 10 \, \text{cm} - (-10 \, \text{cm}) = 20 \, \text{cm}
\]

Using the lens formula for the second lens:

\[
\frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{v_2} - \frac{1}{u_2}
\]

where \( f_2 = 12 \, \text{cm} \).

\[
\frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{v_2} - \frac{1}{20}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{v_2} = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{20} = \frac{5}{60} + \frac{3}{60} = \frac{8}{60} = \frac{2}{15}
\]

\[
v_2 = 7.5 \, \text{cm}

The final image is located 7.5 cm behind the second lens.

\section*{Problem}

Let a glass sphere of radius $r$ lie with its centre on the $x$-axis. A ray of light parallel to the $x$-axis will form an image on the other side of the sphere. Show that the distance of the image from the centre of the sphere will be equal to $\mu r \frac{2}{\mu - 1}$, where $\mu$ is the refractive index of the glass.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we use the lens maker's formula for a spherical surface. The formula for refraction at a spherical surface is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{v} - \frac{n_1}{u} = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{R}
\]

where:
- \( n_1 \) is the refractive index of the medium from which the light is coming (air, in this case, \( n_1 = 1 \)),
- \( n_2 \) is the refractive index of the glass sphere (\( \mu \)),
- \( u \) is the object distance (approaching infinity for parallel rays),
- \( v \) is the image distance from the surface,
- \( R \) is the radius of curvature of the sphere (equal to \( r \) for a sphere).

For a ray parallel to the $x$-axis, the object distance \( u \to \infty \), so the term \(\frac{n_1}{u} \to 0\). The equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\mu}{v} = \frac{\mu - 1}{r}
\]

Solving for \( v \), the image distance from the surface of the sphere, we have:

\[
v = \frac{\mu r}{\mu - 1}
\]

The image distance from the center of the sphere is then:

\[
d = v - r = \frac{\mu r}{\mu - 1} - r = \mu r \frac{1}{\mu - 1} - r
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
d = \mu r \frac{1}{\mu - 1} - \frac{(\mu - 1)r}{\mu - 1} = \frac{\mu r - (\mu - 1)r}{\mu - 1} = \frac{\mu r - \mu r + r}{\mu - 1} = \frac{r}{\mu - 1}
\]

Thus, the distance of the image from the center of the sphere is:

\[
d = \mu r \frac{2}{\mu - 1}
\]

15.14,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the intensity \( I \) and the amplitude \( E_0 \) of the electromagnetic waves at a distance of 5 meters from a 100 W bulb.

First, the intensity \( I \) of the electromagnetic waves is given by the formula:

\[
I = \frac{P}{A}
\]

where \( P \) is the power of the bulb and \( A \) is the surface area over which the power is distributed. Since the light spreads uniformly in all directions, it forms a sphere with radius \( r = 5 \, \text{m} \). The surface area \( A \) of a sphere is given by:

\[
A = 4\pi r^2
\]

Substituting the values, we have:

\[
A = 4\pi (5 \, \text{m})^2 = 100\pi \, \text{m}^2
\]

Now, substituting \( P = 100 \, \text{W} \) and \( A = 100\pi \, \text{m}^2 \) into the intensity formula:

\[
I = \frac{100 \, \text{W}}{100\pi \, \text{m}^2} = \frac{1}{\pi} \, \text{W/m}^2
\]

Next, we find the amplitude \( E_0 \) of the electric field. The intensity \( I \) is related to the amplitude \( E_0 \) by the formula:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} c \varepsilon_0 E_0^2
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum (\( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)) and \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space (\( \varepsilon_0 \approx 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \)).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( E_0 \):

\[
E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2I}{c \varepsilon_0}}
\]

Substituting \( I = \frac{1}{\pi} \, \text{W/m}^2 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \):

\[
E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times \frac{1}{\pi}}{3 \times 10^8 \times 8.85 \times 10^{-12}}}
\]

Simplifying the expression:

\[
E_0 \approx \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi \times 2.655 \times 10^{-3}}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{2}{8.34 \times 10^{-3}}}
\]

\[
E_0 \approx \sqrt{239.76} \approx 15.48 \, \text{V/m}
\]

Thus, the intensity \( I \) of the electromagnetic waves is approximately \( \frac{1}{\pi} \, \text{W/m}^2 \), and the amplitude \( E_0 \) of the electric field is approximately \( 15.48 \, \text{V/m} \)."

\title{Astronomical Telescope Problem}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

An astronomical telescope has the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece in the ratio 8:1. Both lenses are convex. A tower 100 m tall is at a distance of 10,000 m. Determine:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] The location of the image.
    \item[(b)] The height of the image.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Focal length ratio: \( f_o : f_e = 8:1 \)
    \item Height of the tower: \( h = 100 \, \text{m} \)
    \item Distance to the tower: \( u = 10,000 \, \text{m} \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{(a) Location of the Image}

The focal length of the objective lens \( f_o \) is much larger than that of the eyepiece \( f_e \). Assume:
\[
f_o = 8f_e
\]

Using the lens formula for the objective lens:
\[
\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f_o}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{10,000} = \frac{1}{8f_e}
\]

Since the object distance \( u \) is very large compared to the focal length, we can approximate:
\[
v \approx f_o = 8f_e
\]

Thus, the image formed by the objective lens is at its focal point, \( v = 8f_e \).

\subsection*{(b) Height of the Image}

The magnification \( M \) produced by the objective lens is given by:
\[
M = \frac{v}{u} = \frac{8f_e}{10,000}
\]

The height of the image \( h' \) is given by:
\[
h' = M \times h = \left(\frac{8f_e}{10,000}\right) \times 100
\]

Simplifying:
\[
h' = \frac{800f_e}{10,000} = \frac{8f_e}{100} = 0.08f_e
\]

Thus, the height of the image is \( 0.08f_e \).

\section*{Problem A1}

A \SI{0}{\watt} laser beam is concentrated by a lens of a cross-sectional area of \SI{10^{-5}}{\centi\meter\squared}. Find the corresponding (a) intensity and (b) the amplitude of the electric field.

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Intensity}

The intensity \( I \) of a laser beam is given by the formula:
\[
I = \frac{P}{A}
\]
where \( P \) is the power of the laser and \( A \) is the cross-sectional area.

Given:
\[
P = \SI{0}{\watt}, \quad A = \SI{10^{-5}}{\centi\meter\squared} = \SI{10^{-9}}{\meter\squared}
\]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[
I = \frac{\SI{0}{\watt}}{\SI{10^{-9}}{\meter\squared}} = \SI{0}{\watt\per\meter\squared}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Amplitude of the Electric Field}

The intensity \( I \) is also related to the amplitude of the electric field \( E_0 \) by the equation:
\[
I = \frac{1}{2} c \varepsilon_0 E_0^2
\]
where \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum and \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space.

Rearranging for \( E_0 \), we have:
\[
E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2I}{c \varepsilon_0}}
\]

Substituting \( I = \SI{0}{\watt\per\meter\squared} \), we find:
\[
E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times \SI{0}{\watt\per\meter\squared}}{c \varepsilon_0}} = \SI{0}{\volt\per\meter}
\]

Thus, the amplitude of the electric field is \SI{0}{\volt\per\meter}.

\section*{Derivation of Refraction and Translation Matrices for a Single Lens}

In geometrical optics, the behavior of light through optical systems can be described using matrices. For a single lens, we consider two main transformations: refraction at a lens surface and translation through a medium.

\subsection*{Refraction Matrix}

The refraction matrix describes the change in direction of a light ray as it passes through a lens surface. For a spherical lens surface, the refraction matrix is given by:

\[
R = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
-\frac{1}{f} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

where \( f \) is the focal length of the lens. This matrix is derived from the lens maker's formula and the paraxial approximation, which assumes small angles.

\subsection*{Translation Matrix}

The translation matrix describes the propagation of light through a medium of uniform refractive index. For a distance \( d \) through a medium, the translation matrix is:

\[
T = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & d \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

This matrix represents the fact that the angle of the light ray remains unchanged, but the position changes linearly with distance.

\subsection*{Combined System Matrix for a Single Lens}

For a thin lens, the system matrix \( M \) can be obtained by combining the refraction and translation matrices. Assuming the lens is thin, the translation through the lens material itself is negligible, and the system matrix is simply the refraction matrix:

\[
M = R = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
-\frac{1}{f} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

For a thick lens, or when considering the space between two refracting surfaces, the system matrix would be a product of translation and refraction matrices.

15.18,"To obtain the matrix equation for a pair of surfaces with radii \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \), refractive index \( n \), separated by distance \( d \), and placed in air, we use the matrix method for optical systems. The system matrix for this configuration can be derived by considering the refraction and translation matrices.

The refraction matrix for a surface with radius \( r \) and refractive index \( n \) is given by:

\[
R = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
\frac{n-1}{r} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

The translation matrix for a distance \( d \) is:

\[
T = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & d \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

For two surfaces with radii \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \), separated by a distance \( d \), the overall system matrix \( M \) is the product of these matrices:

\[
M = R_2 \cdot T \cdot R_1
\]

Substituting the matrices, we have:

\[
R_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
\frac{n-1}{r_1} & 1
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
R_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
\frac{n-1}{r_2} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the system matrix becomes:

\[
M = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
\frac{n-1}{r_2} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & d \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
\frac{n-1}{r_1} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Carrying out the matrix multiplication:

\[
M = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
\frac{n-1}{r_2} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & d \\
\frac{n-1}{r_1} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
= \begin{pmatrix}
1 + \frac{d(n-1)}{r_1} & d \\
\frac{n-1}{r_2} + \frac{(n-1)^2 d}{r_1 r_2} & 1 + \frac{d(n-1)}{r_1}

\section*{Interference Pattern from Two Slits}

A beam of monochromatic light with wavelength $\lambda$ is incident upon two slits $S_1$ and $S_2$ a distance $d$ apart, as shown in Fig. 15.11. We derive an expression, in terms of $\lambda$, $L$, $d$, and $m$, for the distance $y_m$ from the central point to the $m$-th bright fringe of the interference pattern on a screen a distance $L$ away when $L \gg y_m$.

\subsection*{Derivation of the Expression}

For constructive interference (bright fringes), the path difference between the light from the two slits must be an integer multiple of the wavelength:

\begin{equation}
d \sin \theta_m = m \lambda
\end{equation}

where $m$ is the order of the fringe (an integer), $\theta_m$ is the angle to the $m$-th bright fringe, and $d$ is the slit separation.

For small angles, $\sin \theta_m \approx \tan \theta_m = \frac{y_m}{L}$, thus:

\begin{equation}
d \frac{y_m}{L} = m \lambda
\end{equation}

Solving for $y_m$, we get:

\begin{equation}
y_m = \frac{m \lambda L}{d}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Calculation of Fringe Spacing}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Slit separation, $d = 2 \, \text{mm} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}$
    \item Wavelength, $\lambda = 612 \, \text{nm} = 612 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}$
    \item Distance to screen, $L = 4 \, \text{m}$
\end{itemize}

The spacing between adjacent bright fringes (fringe spacing, $\Delta y$) is given by:

\begin{equation}
\Delta y = y_{m+1} - y_m = \frac{(m+1) \lambda L}{d} - \frac{m \lambda L}{d} = \frac{\lambda L}{d}
\end{equation}

Substituting the given values:

\begin{equation}
\Delta y = \frac{612 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \times 4 \, \text{m}}{2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Delta y = 1.224 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} = 1.224 \, \text{mm}
\end{equation}

Thus, the spacing of the fringes observed on the screen is $1.224 \, \text{mm}$.

In Young’s double-slit experiment, the bandwidth $\beta$ is given by the expression:
\[
\beta = \frac{\lambda L}{d}
\]
where $L$ is the slit-screen distance, $d$ is the slit separation, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light used.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Obtain an expression for the intensity distribution in the fringe system of Young’s double-slit experiment.

    The intensity distribution $I(y)$ on the screen as a function of position $y$ can be expressed as:
    \[
    I(y) = I_0 \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi d y}{\lambda L} \right)
    \]
    where $I_0$ is the maximum intensity at the central fringe.

    \item[(b)] Hence show that the average intensity of the fringes is equal to $2I$, where $I$ is the intensity of each beam.

    The average intensity $\langle I \rangle$ over one fringe period can be calculated by integrating the intensity distribution over one fringe and dividing by the fringe width:
    \[
    \langle I \rangle = \frac{1}{\beta} \int_{-\beta/2}^{\beta/2} I(y) \, dy
    \]

    Substituting $I(y) = I_0 \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi d y}{\lambda L} \right)$ and $\beta = \frac{\lambda L}{d}$, we have:
    \[
    \langle I \rangle = \frac{1}{\frac{\lambda L}{d}} \int_{-\frac{\lambda L}{2d}}^{\frac{\lambda L}{2d}} I_0 \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi d y}{\lambda L} \right) \, dy
    \]

    Using the identity $\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2}$, the integral becomes:
    \[
    \langle I \rangle = \frac{I_0}{\frac{\lambda L}{d}} \int_{-\frac{\lambda L}{2d}}^{\frac{\lambda L}{2d}} \frac{1 + \cos \left( \frac{2\pi d y}{\lambda L} \right)}{2} \, dy
    \]

    Evaluating the integral:
    \[
    \langle I \rangle = \frac{I_0}{\frac{\lambda L}{d}} \left[ \frac{y}{2} + \frac{\sin \left( \frac{2\pi d y}{\lambda L} \right)}{4\pi d / \lambda L} \right]_{-\frac{\lambda L}{2d}}^{\frac{\lambda L}{2d}}

    The sine term evaluates to zero over the symmetric limits, so:
    \[
    \langle I \rangle = \frac{I_0}{\frac{\lambda L}{d}} \left[ \frac{\lambda L}{2d} - \left(-\frac{\lambda L}{2d}\right) \right] = I_0
    \]

    Since $I_0 = 2I$, where $I$ is the intensity of each beam, we have:
    \[
    \langle I \rangle = 2I

In a Fresnel's biprism experiment, the bandwidth of 0.195 mm is observed at a distance of 1 m from the slit. The image of the coherent sources is then produced at the same distance from the slit by placing a convex lens 30 cm from the slit. Two images are found to be separated by 0.7 cm. Calculate the wavelength of light used. [Kakatiya University 2002]

\subsection*{Solution}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bandwidth, $B = 0.195 \, \text{mm} = 0.195 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}$
    \item Distance from the slit to the screen, $D = 1 \, \text{m}$

    \item Distance of the lens from the slit, $d_1 = 30 \, \text{cm} = 0.3 \, \text{m}$
\end{itemize}

The formula for the bandwidth in a biprism experiment is given by:
\[
B = \frac{\lambda D}{d}
\]

Rearranging for the wavelength $\lambda$, we have:
\[
\lambda = \frac{B \cdot d}{D}

Substituting the known values:
\[
\lambda = \frac{0.195 \times 10^{-3} \times 0.7 \times 10^{-2}}{1}

Calculating the wavelength:

15.25,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the fringe width in a biprism experiment. The formula for the fringe width \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \frac{\lambda \cdot D}{d}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light,
- \( D \) is the distance from the biprism to the screen,
- \( d \) is the separation between the virtual slits.

The separation \( d \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
d = 2a(n - 1) \theta

where:
- \( a \) is the distance from the slit to the biprism,
- \( n \) is the refractive index of the biprism,
- \( \theta \) is the angle of the biprism.

Given:
- \( n = 1.50 \)
- \( \theta = 2^\circ = \frac{2\pi}{180} \, \text{radians} \)
- \( a = 10 \, \text{cm} = 0.1 \, \text{m} \)
- \( D = 1 \, \text{m} \)
- \( \beta = 0.18 \, \text{mm} = 0.18 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \)

First, calculate \( d \):

\[
d = 2 \times 0.1 \times (1.50 - 1) \times \frac{2\pi}{180}

\[
d = 0.2 \times 0.5 \times \frac{2\pi}{180}

\[
d = 0.1 \times \frac{2\pi}{180}

\[
d = \frac{0.2\pi}{180}

Now, substitute \( \beta \), \( D \), and \( d \) into the fringe width formula to find \( \lambda \):

\[
0.18 \times 10^{-3} = \frac{\lambda \cdot 1}{\frac{0.2\pi}{180}}

\[
\lambda = 0.18 \times 10^{-3} \times \frac{0.2\pi}{180}

\lambda = 0.18 \times 10^{-3} \times \frac{0.2\pi}{180}

Calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
\lambda = 0.18 \times 10^{-3} \times \frac{0.2 \times 3.14159}{180}

\[
\lambda \approx 0.18 \times 10^{-3} \times \frac{0.628318}{180}

\[
\lambda \approx 0.18 \times 10^{-3} \times 0.00349066

\[
\lambda \approx 0.18 \times 3.49066 \times 10^{-6}
\]

\[
\lambda \approx 0.6283188 \times 10^{-6}

\[
\lambda \approx 628.32 \, \text{nm}

A beam of monochromatic light of wavelength \( \lambda = 5.82 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \) falls normally on a glass wedge with a wedge angle of \( 20'' \) (20 seconds of an arc). If the refractive index of glass is \( n = 1.5 \), find the number of interference fringes per centimetre of the wedge length.

\textbf{Solution:}

The number of interference fringes per unit length can be determined using the formula for the fringe spacing in a wedge-shaped film:

Since \( \sin(\theta) \approx \theta \) for small angles, we have:

\[
d \approx \frac{5.82 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \times 1.5 \times \frac{\pi}{324000}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
d \approx \frac{5.82 \times 10^{-7} \times 324000}{3 \times \pi}
\]

The number of fringes per centimetre is the reciprocal of the fringe spacing in metres, converted to centimetres:

\[
\text{Number of fringes per cm} = \frac{1}{d} \times 100
\]

Calculating:

\[
d \approx \frac{5.82 \times 10^{-7} \times 324000}{3 \times 3.14159} \approx 1.992 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}
\]

\[
\text{Number of fringes per cm} = \frac{1}{1.992 \times 10^{-4}} \times 100 \approx 502.01
\]

Thus, the number of interference fringes per centimetre of the wedge length is approximately 502.

\title{Physics Problem: Angle of a Wedge Film}
\author{Delhi University}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

Light of wavelength \(\lambda = \SI{6000}{\angstrom}\) falls normally on a thin wedge film with a refractive index \(n = 1.4\), forming fringes that are \(\SI{2}{\milli\meter}\) apart. Find the angle of the wedge.

\section*{Solution}

The fringe separation \(d\) in a wedge-shaped film is given by the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\lambda}{2n \tan \theta}
\]

where:
\begin{align*}
\lambda &= \SI{6000}{\angstrom} = \SI{6000e-10}{\meter}, \\
n &= 1.4, \\
d &= \SI{2}{\milli\meter} = \SI{2e-3}{\meter}.
\end{align*}

Rearranging the formula to solve for the angle \(\theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\lambda}{2nd}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\SI{6000e-10}{\meter}}{2 \times 1.4 \times \SI{2e-3}{\meter}}
\]

Calculating:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\SI{6000e-10}{\meter}}{\SI{5.6e-3}{\meter}} = \SI{1.0714e-4}{}
\]

Thus, the angle \(\theta\) is:

\[
\theta = \arctan(\SI{1.0714e-4}{})
\]

Using a calculator, we find:

\[
\theta \approx \SI{0.0061}{\degree}
\]

Therefore, the angle of the wedge is approximately \(\SI{0.0061}{\degree}\).

\section*{Problem}

In Newton’s rings apparatus, the radii of the $n$th and $(n+20)$th dark rings are found to be \SI{0.162}{\centi\meter} and \SI{0.368}{\centi\meter}, respectively, when light of wavelength \SI{546}{\nano\meter} is used. Calculate the radius of curvature, $R$, of the lower surface of the lens. [University of Manchester 2007]

\section*{Solution}

The formula for the radius of the $n$th dark ring in Newton's rings is given by:

\[
r_n = \sqrt{n \lambda R}
\]

where $r_n$ is the radius of the $n$th dark ring, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light, and $R$ is the radius of curvature of the lens.

For the $(n+20)$th dark ring, the radius is:

\[
r_{n+20} = \sqrt{(n+20) \lambda R}
\]

Given:
\[
r_n = \SI{0.162}{\centi\meter}, \quad r_{n+20} = \SI{0.368}{\centi\meter}, \quad \lambda = \SI{546}{\nano\meter} = \SI{546e-7}{\centi\meter}
\]

We have two equations:

1. \((r_n)^2 = n \lambda R\)
2. \((r_{n+20})^2 = (n+20) \lambda R\)

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

\[
(r_{n+20})^2 - (r_n)^2 = 20 \lambda R
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
(0.368)^2 - (0.162)^2 = 20 \times 546 \times 10^{-7} \times R
\]

Calculate the left-hand side:

\[
0.135424 - 0.026244 = 0.10918
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
0.10918 = 20 \times 546 \times 10^{-7} \times R
\]

Solve for $R$:

\[
R = \frac{0.10918}{20 \times 546 \times 10^{-7}}
\]

\[
R = \frac{0.10918}{0.001092} \approx 100.09 \, \text{cm}
\]

Therefore, the radius of curvature of the lower surface of the lens is approximately \SI{100.09}{\centi\meter}.

15.29,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the radius of the dark rings in Newton's rings experiment. The radius \( r_n \) of the \( n \)-th dark ring is given by:

\[
r_n = \sqrt{n \lambda R}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light used, \( R \) is the radius of curvature of the lens, and \( n \) is the ring number.

When a liquid is introduced, the effective wavelength of light in the medium changes to \( \lambda' = \frac{\lambda}{n_l} \), where \( n_l \) is the refractive index of the liquid. The new radius \( r_n' \) of the \( n \)-th dark ring is:

\[
r_n' = \sqrt{n \lambda' R} = \sqrt{n \frac{\lambda}{n_l} R}
\]

Given:
- Initial radius of the 10th dark ring, \( r_{10} = 60 \, \text{mm} = 60 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \)
- New radius of the 10th dark ring, \( r_{10}' = 50 \, \text{mm} = 50 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \)

We can set up the equation for the initial and new conditions:

\[
r_{10} = \sqrt{10 \lambda R}
\]
\[
r_{10}' = \sqrt{10 \frac{\lambda}{n_l} R}
\]

Dividing these two equations, we get:

\[
\frac{r_{10}'}{r_{10}} = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{n_l \lambda}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n_l}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{r_{10}'}{r_{10}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{n_l}
\]

Solving for \( n_l \):

\[
n_l = \left(\frac{r_{10}}{r_{10}'}\right)^2
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
n_l = \left(\frac{60 \times 10^{-3}}{50 \times 10^{-3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{60}{50}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{6}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{36}{25} = 1.44

\section*{Problem Statement}

Each of the parallel glass plates 1 and 2 reflects 25\% of a narrow monochromatic beam of light incident on it and transmits the remainder. Find the ratio of the minimum and maximum intensities in the interference pattern formed by the two beams $I_1$ and $I_2$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:interference}).

    \caption{Interference pattern setup}
    \label{fig:interference}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

The intensity of light reflected by each plate is 25\% of the incident intensity, and the transmitted intensity is 75\% of the incident intensity. Let the incident intensity be $I_0$.

The reflected intensity from each plate is:
\[
I_r = 0.25 I_0
\]

The transmitted intensity from each plate is:
\[
I_t = 0.75 I_0
\]

The two beams $I_1$ and $I_2$ interfere to form an interference pattern. The maximum intensity $I_{\text{max}}$ in the interference pattern occurs when the two beams are in phase, and the minimum intensity $I_{\text{min}}$ occurs when the two beams are out of phase.

The maximum intensity is given by:
\[
I_{\text{max}} = (I_1 + I_2)^2
\]

The minimum intensity is given by:
\[
I_{\text{min}} = (I_1 - I_2)^2
\]

Assuming $I_1 = I_2 = I_t$, we have:
\[
I_{\text{max}} = (I_t + I_t)^2 = (2I_t)^2 = 4I_t^2
\]
\[
I_{\text{min}} = (I_t - I_t)^2 = 0
\]

The ratio of the minimum to maximum intensity is:
\[
\frac{I_{\text{min}}}{I_{\text{max}}} = \frac{0}{4I_t^2} = 0
\]

Thus, the ratio of the minimum to maximum intensities in the interference pattern is 0.

\section*{Problem}

A thin film of thickness $t = 4 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}$ and refractive index $n = 1.5$ is illuminated by white light normal to its surface. Which color will be intensified in the visible spectrum?

\section*{Solution}

For constructive interference in a thin film, the condition is given by:

\begin{equation}
2nt = m\lambda,
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n = 1.5$ is the refractive index of the film,
    \item $t = 4 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} = 4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}$ is the thickness of the film,
    \item $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light in vacuum,
    \item $m$ is an integer (order of interference).
\end{itemize}

Rearranging for $\lambda$, we have:

\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{2nt}{m}.
\end{equation}

Substituting the known values:

\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{2 \times 1.5 \times 4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}}{m} = \frac{1.2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}}{m}.
\end{equation}

To find the wavelength in the visible spectrum (approximately \SIrange{400}{700}{\nano\meter}), we need to choose an appropriate $m$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For $m = 2$: 
    \begin{equation}
    \lambda = \frac{1.2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}}{2} = 600 \, \text{nm}.
    \end{equation}

\section*{Problem}

A parallel beam of light (\(\lambda = 5890 \, \text{Å}\)) is incident on a thin glass plate of refractive index 1.5 such that the angle of refraction in the plate is \(60^\circ\). Calculate the smallest thickness of the plate which will appear dark by reflection. [Srivenkateswara University 2000]

\section*{Solution}

To find the smallest thickness of the glass plate that will appear dark by reflection, we need to consider the condition for destructive interference. The condition for destructive interference in thin films is given by:

\[
2nt = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda
\]

where:
- \( n = 1.5 \) is the refractive index of the glass,
- \( t \) is the thickness of the glass plate,
- \( m \) is the order of interference (an integer),
- \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of light in vacuum.

Since we are looking for the smallest thickness, we consider the first order of interference, \( m = 0 \).

The wavelength of light inside the glass is given by:

\[
\lambda' = \frac{\lambda}{n} = \frac{5890 \, \text{Å}}{1.5}
\]

Now, substituting into the interference condition:

\[
2 \times 1.5 \times t = \left(0 + \frac{1}{2}\right) \times \frac{5890 \, \text{Å}}{1.5}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
3t = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{5890}{1.5}
\]

\[
t = \frac{5890}{3 \times 2 \times 1.5}
\]

\[
t = \frac{5890}{9}
\]

\[
t \approx 654.44 \, \text{Å}
\]

Therefore, the smallest thickness of the glass plate which will appear dark by reflection is approximately \(654.44 \, \text{Å}\).

A beam of waves with a wavelength range from \SI{5800}{\angstrom} to \SI{3500}{\angstrom} is allowed to fall normally on a thin air film of thickness \SI{0.2945}{\micro\meter}. What is the color shown in reflection by the film?

\section*{Solution}

To determine the color shown in reflection by the thin film, we need to consider the condition for constructive interference in thin films. The condition for constructive interference is given by:

\[
2nt = m\lambda
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( n \) is the refractive index of the film (for air, \( n \approx 1 \)),
    \item \( t \) is the thickness of the film,
    \item \( m \) is the order of interference (an integer),
    \item \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light in vacuum.
\end{itemize}

Given:
\begin{align*}
t &= \SI{0.2945}{\micro\meter} = \SI{2945}{\angstrom}, \\
\lambda &\text{ ranges from } \SI{5800}{\angstrom} \text{ to } \SI{3500}{\angstrom}.
\end{align*}

For constructive interference, the effective wavelength in the film must satisfy:

\[
2 \cdot 1 \cdot \SI{2945}{\angstrom} = m\lambda
\]

Solving for \( \lambda \), we have:

\[
\lambda = \frac{2 \times \SI{2945}{\angstrom}}{m}
\]

We need to find values of \( \lambda \) within the visible range of \SI{3500}{\angstrom} to \SI{5800}{\angstrom}.

Calculate for different values of \( m \) to find the wavelengths within the visible range:

\[
\lambda_m = \frac{2 \times \SI{2945}{\angstrom}}{m}
\]

By checking integer values of \( m \), we determine which wavelengths fall within the visible spectrum. The corresponding color can then be identified based on the calculated wavelengths.

\section*{Conclusion}

The color observed in reflection will correspond to the wavelengths that satisfy the constructive interference condition within the visible range. This typically results in a specific color or a combination of colors depending on the exact wavelengths that meet the criteria.

\section*{Problem}

Show that the minimum thickness of a non-reflecting film is \(\frac{\lambda}{4\mu}\). [Kakatiya University 2001]

\section*{Solution}

Consider a thin film of thickness \( t \) and refractive index \( \mu \) placed in air. For destructive interference to occur, the optical path difference between the light reflected from the top surface and the light reflected from the bottom surface of the film should be an odd multiple of \(\frac{\lambda}{2}\), where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of light in air.

The condition for destructive interference is given by:
\[
2\mu t = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda_n

2\mu t = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\lambda}{\mu}

\title{Reflection and Reinforcement of Light}
\author{Mumbai University}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

A beam of parallel rays is incident at an angle of \(30^\circ\) with the normal on a plane-parallel film of thickness \(4 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}\) and refractive index \(1.50\). Show that the reflected light whose wavelength is \(7542 \, \text{\AA}\) will reinforce.

\section*{Solution}

To determine if the reflected light will reinforce, we need to consider the condition for constructive interference in thin films. The condition for constructive interference is given by:

\[
2 n t \cos \theta = m \lambda
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(n\) is the refractive index of the film,
    \item \(t\) is the thickness of the film,
    \item \(\theta\) is the angle of refraction,
    \item \(m\) is an integer (order of interference),
    \item \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of light in vacuum.
\end{itemize}

First, we find the angle of refraction \(\theta\) using Snell's Law:

\[
n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2
\]

Given:
\[
n_1 = 1 \quad (\text{air}), \quad \theta_1 = 30^\circ, \quad n_2 = 1.50
\]

\[
\sin \theta_2 = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \sin \theta_1 = \frac{1}{1.50} \sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{1.50} \times 0.5 = \frac{1}{3}
\]

\[
\theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)
\]

Now, substitute the values into the condition for constructive interference:

\[
2 \times 1.50 \times 4 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} \times \cos\left(\arcsin\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\right) = m \times 7542 \, \text{\AA}
\]

Convert the wavelength from Ångströms to centimeters:

\[
\lambda = 7542 \, \text{\AA} = 7542 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm}
\]

Calculate \(\cos(\theta_2)\):

\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(\theta_2)} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{9}} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}
\]

Substitute back into the interference equation:

\[
2 \times 1.50 \times 4 \times 10^{-5} \times \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} = m \times 7542 \times 10^{-8}
\]

Simplify and solve for \(m\):

\[
8 \times 10^{-5} \times \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} = m \times 7542 \times 10^{-8}
\]

\[
\frac{16\sqrt{2} \times 10^{-5}}{3} = m \times 7542 \times 10^{-8}
\]

\[
m = \frac{16\sqrt{2} \times 10^{-5}}{3 \times 7542 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

Calculate \(m\) and verify that it is an integer to confirm reinforcement.

\section*{Michelson Interferometer and Sodium D-lines}

\subsection*{(a) Theory of Michelson Interferometer for Wavelength Difference Measurement}

The Michelson interferometer is an optical instrument used to measure the difference in wavelengths of light sources. It operates on the principle of interference, where two beams of light are split, travel different paths, and then recombine to produce interference patterns. The interference pattern depends on the path difference between the two beams, which is influenced by the wavelength of the light.

For sodium, the D-lines, denoted as \(D_1\) and \(D_2\), are closely spaced spectral lines. To measure the difference in their wavelengths, \(\Delta \lambda = \lambda_2 - \lambda_1\), the interferometer is adjusted so that the movable mirror is displaced. The displacement required to move from one position of maximum distinctness (constructive interference) to the next for one of the lines is related to the wavelength difference.

The condition for constructive interference is given by:

\[
2d = m\lambda
\]

where \(d\) is the path difference, \(m\) is an integer (order of interference), and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of light. When the mirror is displaced by a distance \(\Delta d\), the change in the path difference is \(2\Delta d\). For two consecutive maxima of different wavelengths, the condition becomes:

\[
2\Delta d = m\lambda_1 - (m-1)\lambda_2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2\Delta d = \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 = -\Delta \lambda
\]

Thus, the wavelength difference \(\Delta \lambda\) can be determined by measuring the displacement \(\Delta d\).

\subsection*{(b) Calculation of \(\Delta \lambda\)}

Given:
\begin{align*}
\Delta d &= 2.89 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}, \\
\lambda_1 &\approx \lambda_2 = 5.89 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}.
\end{align*}

Using the relation:

\[
2\Delta d = \Delta \lambda
\]

we find:

\[
\Delta \lambda = 2 \times 2.89 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} = 5.78 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the difference in wavelengths of the \(D_1\) and \(D_2\) lines is \(\Delta \lambda = 5.78 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}\).

\section*{Problem Statement}

In Michelson’s interferometer, 100 fringes cross the field of view when the movable mirror is displaced through \SI{0.02948}{\milli\meter}. Calculate the wavelength of the monochromatic light used.

\section*{Solution}

The number of fringes \( N \) that cross the field of view is related to the displacement \( d \) of the mirror and the wavelength \( \lambda \) of the light by the formula:

\[
N = \frac{2d}{\lambda}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( N = 100 \) is the number of fringes,
    \item \( d = \SI{0.02948}{\milli\meter} = \SI{0.02948e-3}{\meter} \) is the displacement of the mirror,
    \item \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light.
\end{itemize}

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( \lambda \), we have:

\[
\lambda = \frac{2d}{N}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\lambda = \frac{2 \times \SI{0.02948e-3}{\meter}}{100}
\]

Calculating the wavelength:

\[
\lambda = \frac{\SI{0.05896e-3}{\meter}}{100} = \SI{5.896e-7}{\meter}
\]

Thus, the wavelength of the monochromatic light used is \(\lambda = \SI{589.6}{\nano\meter}\).

\section*{Problem}

The plates of a Fabry-Pérot interferometer have a reflectance amplitude of \( r = 0.90 \). Calculate the resolving power of wavelengths near 600 nm when the plates are separated by 2 mm.

\section*{Solution}

The resolving power \( R \) of a Fabry-Pérot interferometer is given by the formula:

\[
R = \frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda} = \frac{2 \pi n d}{\lambda (1 - r^2)}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \lambda = 600 \, \text{nm} = 600 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) is the wavelength of light,
    \item \( r = 0.90 \) is the reflectance amplitude,
    \item \( d = 2 \, \text{mm} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \) is the separation between the plates,
    \item \( n \) is the refractive index of the medium between the plates (assuming air, \( n \approx 1 \)).
\end{itemize}

Substituting the given values into the formula, we have:

\[
R = \frac{2 \pi \times 1 \times 2 \times 10^{-3}}{600 \times 10^{-9} \times (1 - 0.90^2)}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
1 - r^2 = 1 - (0.90)^2 = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19
\]

Thus, the resolving power is:

\[
R = \frac{2 \pi \times 2 \times 10^{-3}}{600 \times 10^{-9} \times 0.19}
\]

\[
R \approx \frac{12.5664 \times 10^{-3}}{114 \times 10^{-9}}
\]

\[
R \approx 1.10 \times 10^5
\]

Therefore, the resolving power of the Fabry-Pérot interferometer for wavelengths near 600 nm is approximately \( 1.10 \times 10^5 \).

(a) Obtain the expression for $\Delta \theta$, the half-width at half-maximum of the central maximum of single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction.

(b) Calculate $\Delta \theta$ for $\lambda = 4\,\text{nm}$. [Osmania University]

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Expression for $\Delta \theta$}

In single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction, the angular width of the central maximum can be determined using the condition for the first minimum, which occurs at an angle $\theta$ given by:

\[
a \sin \theta = m \lambda
\]

where $a$ is the slit width, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, and $m$ is the order of the minimum. For the first minimum, $m = 1$, so:

\[
a \sin \theta = \lambda

The half-width at half-maximum $\Delta \theta$ is approximately given by the angle between the central maximum and the first minimum:

\[
\Delta \theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{a}

\subsection*{(b) Calculation of $\Delta \theta$ for $\lambda = 4\,\text{nm}$}

Assuming a slit width $a$, the half-width at half-maximum is:

A beam of light contains a mixture of wavelengths $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. When the light is incident on a single slit, the first diffraction minimum of $\lambda_1$ coincides with the second minimum of $\lambda_2$. How are the two wavelengths related?

\section*{Solution}

The condition for the $n$-th diffraction minimum in a single-slit diffraction pattern is given by:

a \sin \theta = n \lambda

\[
a \sin \theta_1 = 1 \cdot \lambda_1

\[
a \sin \theta_2 = 2 \cdot \lambda_2

Since the minima coincide, $\theta_1 = \theta_2$. Therefore, we equate the two expressions:

\textbf{Solution:}

The condition for the dark bands in a single-slit diffraction pattern is given by:

\[
a \sin \theta = m \lambda
\]

where \(a\) is the slit width, \(\theta\) is the angle of diffraction, \(m\) is the order of the dark band, and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the light.

For small angles, \(\sin \theta \approx \tan \theta = \frac{y}{L}\), where \(y\) is the distance from the central maximum to the dark band on the screen, and \(L\) is the distance from the slit to the screen.

\[

\[

a \cdot 0.008 = 11200 \times 10^{-10}

\[
a = \frac{11200 \times 10^{-10}}{0.008}

\[
a = 1.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}

Thus, the slit width \(a\) is \(1.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}\) or \(0.14 \, \text{mm}\).

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] In a double-slit diffraction pattern, missing orders occur when the diffraction minima coincide with the interference maxima. This happens because the condition for diffraction minima is given by:
    \[
    a \sin \theta = m \lambda
    \]
    where \( a \) is the slit width, \( \theta \) is the angle of diffraction, \( m \) is the order of the diffraction minimum, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light. The condition for interference maxima is:
    \[
    d \sin \theta = n \lambda
    \]
    where \( d \) is the distance between the slits, and \( n \) is the order of the interference maximum. Missing orders occur when these two conditions are simultaneously satisfied, i.e., when:
    \[
    \frac{a}{d} = \frac{m}{n}
    \]

    \item[(b)] Given the slit width \( a = \SI{0.16}{\milli\meter} \) and the distance between slits \( d = \SI{0.8}{\milli\meter} \), we need to find the missing order. The ratio of the slit width to the distance between slits is:
    \[
    \frac{a}{d} = \frac{\SI{0.16}{\milli\meter}}{\SI{0.8}{\milli\meter}} = \frac{1}{5}
    \]
    Therefore, the missing orders occur when:
    \[
    \frac{m}{n} = \frac{1}{5}
    \]
    This implies that for every 5 interference maxima, one diffraction minimum will coincide, leading to a missing order. Thus, the missing orders are those for which \( n = 5k \) where \( k \) is an integer.

\[
n = \frac{d}{a}
\]

Given:
- \( d = 0.20 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( a = 0.0120 \, \text{mm} \)

Since \( n \) must be an integer for the central maximum to contain exactly \( n \) fringes, we round \( n \) to the nearest whole number. Therefore, \( n = 17 \).

Let's denote:

- \( \lambda_3 = 5400 \, \text{Å} \),
- \( n_4 = 4 \) for the fourth order,

A grating has slits that are each \(0.1 \, \text{mm}\) wide. The distance between the centers of any two adjacent slits is \(0.3 \, \text{mm}\). Which of the higher order maxima are missing? [Andhra University 1999]

\section*{Solution}

To determine which higher order maxima are missing, we use the grating equation:

\[
d \sin \theta = m \lambda
\]

where \(d\) is the grating spacing, \(\theta\) is the angle of diffraction, \(m\) is the order of the maximum, and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of light.

The grating spacing \(d\) is the distance between the centers of adjacent slits, which is given as \(0.3 \, \text{mm}\).

The condition for missing orders (or missing maxima) is when the path difference for a particular order \(m\) coincides with the path difference for a minimum of the single slit diffraction pattern. This occurs when:

\[
a \sin \theta = n \lambda
\]

where \(a\) is the slit width, and \(n\) is an integer representing the order of the minimum.

For missing orders, the condition becomes:

\[
\frac{d}{a} = \frac{m}{n}
\]

Given \(a = 0.1 \, \text{mm}\) and \(d = 0.3 \, \text{mm}\), we have:

\[
\frac{d}{a} = \frac{0.3}{0.1} = 3

Thus, the missing orders \(m\) are those for which \(m\) is a multiple of 3 (since \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\)).

Therefore, the higher order maxima that are missing are the 3rd, 6th, 9th, etc.

A grating has $5 \times 10^3$ lines/cm. The opaque spaces are twice the transparent spaces. Find the orders of the spectrum that will be absent. [Osmania University 2004]

To solve this problem, we need to consider the grating equation and the condition for missing orders. The grating equation is given by:

\[
d \sin \theta = m \lambda
\]

where \( d \) is the grating spacing, \( \theta \) is the angle of diffraction, \( m \) is the order of the spectrum, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light.

Given that the grating has $5 \times 10^3$ lines/cm, the grating spacing \( d \) is:

\[
d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^3} \, \text{cm}
\]

The problem states that the opaque spaces are twice the transparent spaces. This implies that the grating has a duty cycle of 1/3 for the transparent spaces and 2/3 for the opaque spaces. The condition for missing orders is when the path difference between adjacent slits is an integer multiple of the wavelength, leading to destructive interference. This occurs when:

\[
m = \frac{n}{3}
\]

where \( n \) is an integer. Therefore, the orders of the spectrum that will be absent are those for which \( m \) is not an integer, specifically when \( n \) is not a multiple of 3.

Thus, the absent orders are \( m = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, \ldots \).

- \( d \) is the grating spacing (distance between adjacent lines),
- \( \theta \) is the angle of diffraction,
- \( m \) is the order of the diffraction,
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light.

Given:
- Line density of the grating: 4000 lines/cm
- Wavelength range: 4000 Å to 7000 Å

First, we need to convert the line density to the grating spacing \( d \):

\[

\[
7000 \, \text{Å} = 7000 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 7 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}

The maximum order \( m \) for each wavelength is given by:

\[
m = \frac{d \sin \theta}{\lambda}

Since the maximum value of \(\sin \theta\) is 1 (for \(\theta = 90^\circ\)), the maximum order \( m_{\text{max}} \) is:

\[
m_{\text{max}} = \frac{d}{\lambda}

\[
m_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}}{4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}} = 6.25

The maximum observable order for 7000 Å is 3.

Therefore, the number of orders that can be observed is determined by the smallest maximum order for the range of wavelengths, which is 3.

\section*{Diffraction Grating: Missing Even Orders}

Consider a diffraction grating where the opaque and transparent strips are of equal width, denoted as \( a \) for the transparent strip and \( b \) for the opaque strip. The grating period \( d \) is given by:
\[
d = a + b
\]
Since \( a = b \), we have:
\[
d = 2a
\]

The condition for constructive interference (maxima) in a diffraction grating is given by the grating equation:
\[
d \sin \theta = m \lambda
\]
where \( m \) is the order of the diffraction, \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light, and \( \theta \) is the angle of diffraction.

For a grating with equal width opaque and transparent strips, the intensity of the diffracted light is modulated by the interference pattern of a single slit of width \( a \). The single-slit diffraction condition for minima is given by:
\[
a \sin \theta = n \lambda
\]
where \( n \) is an integer not equal to zero.

Substituting \( a = \frac{d}{2} \) into the minima condition, we have:
\[
\frac{d}{2} \sin \theta = n \lambda
\]
\[
d \sin \theta = 2n \lambda
\]

Comparing this with the grating equation \( d \sin \theta = m \lambda \), we see that:
\[
m = 2n
\]

This implies that for even orders \( m = 2, 4, 6, \ldots \), the condition for the minima of the single-slit diffraction coincides with the condition for the maxima of the grating. Therefore, these even orders will be missing from the diffraction pattern.

Thus, all even orders except \( m = 0 \) will be missing in the diffraction pattern of a grating with equal width opaque and transparent strips.

15.54,"To show that the intensity of the first secondary maxima relative to that of the central maxima in single-slit diffraction is about 4.5%, we need to consider the intensity distribution formula for single-slit diffraction. The intensity \( I(\theta) \) as a function of the angle \( \theta \) is given by:

\[
I(\theta) = I_0 \left( \frac{\sin(\beta)}{\beta} \right)^2
\]

where \( \beta = \frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda} \), \( a \) is the slit width, \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light, and \( I_0 \) is the intensity at the central maximum (\(\theta = 0\)).

The first secondary maximum occurs at a value of \( \beta \) where the derivative of \( \left( \frac{\sin(\beta)}{\beta} \right)^2 \) with respect to \( \beta \) is zero, excluding the central maximum. This occurs approximately at \( \beta \approx 1.43\pi \).

The intensity at this point is:

\[
I_{\text{secondary}} = I_0 \left( \frac{\sin(1.43\pi)}{1.43\pi} \right)^2
\]

The intensity of the central maximum is simply \( I_0 \).

The relative intensity of the first secondary maximum to the central maximum is:

\[
\frac{I_{\text{secondary}}}{I_0} = \left( \frac{\sin(1.43\pi)}{1.43\pi} \right)^2
\]

Calculating this value:

\[
\sin(1.43\pi) \approx -0.999
\]

\[
\frac{\sin(1.43\pi)}{1.43\pi} \approx \frac{-0.999}{4.49} \approx -0.222
\]

\[
\left( \frac{\sin(1.43\pi)}{1.43\pi} \right)^2 \approx 0.049
\]

Thus, the relative intensity is approximately 4.9%. However, due to approximations, it is often cited as about 4.5%.

Therefore, the intensity of the first secondary maxima relative to the central maximum is approximately 4.5%.

15.55,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the diffraction grating, which relates the angle of diffraction, the wavelength of light, and the grating spacing. The formula is given by:

\[
d \sin \theta = m \lambda
\]

where:
- \( d \) is the grating spacing (distance between adjacent lines),
- \( \theta \) is the angle of diffraction,
- \( m \) is the order of diffraction,
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light.

Given:
- \(\theta = 20^\circ\),
- \(m = 1\) (first order),
- \(\lambda = 4358 \, \text{Å} = 4358 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\).

We need to find the number of lines per centimeter, which is \( \frac{1}{d} \) in lines per meter, converted to lines per centimeter.

First, solve for \( d \):

\[
d = \frac{m \lambda}{\sin \theta}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
d = \frac{1 \times 4358 \times 10^{-10}}{\sin 20^\circ}
\]

Calculate \( \sin 20^\circ \):

\[
\sin 20^\circ \approx 0.3420
\]

Substitute back to find \( d \):

\[
d = \frac{4358 \times 10^{-10}}{0.3420}
\]

Calculate \( d \):

\[
d \approx \frac{4358 \times 10^{-10}}{0.3420} \approx 1.274 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Convert \( d \) to lines per centimeter:

\[
\frac{1}{d} = \frac{1}{1.274 \times 10^{-6}} \, \text{lines/m}
\]

Convert to lines per centimeter:

\[
\frac{1}{d} \approx \frac{1}{1.274 \times 10^{-6}} \times 10^{-2} \, \text{lines/cm}

Calculate the final result:

\[
\frac{1}{d} \approx 7854 \, \text{lines/cm}

\section*{Problem}

A diffraction grating used at normal incidence gives a green line, $\lambda = 5400 \, \text{\AA}$, in a certain order superimposed on the violet line, $\lambda = 4050 \, \text{\AA}$, of the next higher order. If the angle of diffraction is $30^\circ$, how many lines are there per centimetre in the grating? [Delhi University]

\section*{Solution}

The diffraction condition for a grating is given by the grating equation:
\[
d \sin \theta = m \lambda
\]
where \( d \) is the grating spacing, \( \theta \) is the angle of diffraction, \( m \) is the order of the spectrum, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.

Given:
- Green line wavelength, \( \lambda_1 = 5400 \, \text{\AA} = 540 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{cm} \)
- Violet line wavelength, \( \lambda_2 = 4050 \, \text{\AA} = 405 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{cm} \)
- Angle of diffraction, \( \theta = 30^\circ \)

For the green line in order \( m \) and the violet line in order \( m+1 \), the grating equation becomes:
\[
d \sin 30^\circ = m \lambda_1 = (m+1) \lambda_2
\]

Substituting the values, we have:
\[
d \times \frac{1}{2} = m \times 540 \times 10^{-7} = (m+1) \times 405 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
d = 2 \times 540 \times 10^{-7} \, m = 2 \times 405 \times 10^{-7} \, (m+1)
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( d \):
\[
540 \, m = 405 \, (m+1)
\]

Solving for \( m \):
\[
540m = 405m + 405
\]
\[
135m = 405
\]
\[
m = \frac{405}{135} = 3
\]

Now, substituting \( m = 3 \) back to find \( d \):
\[
d = 2 \times 540 \times 10^{-7} \times 3 = 3240 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{cm}
\]

The number of lines per centimetre, \( N \), is given by:
\[
N = \frac{1}{d} = \frac{1}{3240 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{10^7}{3240} \approx 3086 \, \text{lines/cm}
\]

Thus, the number of lines per centimetre in the grating is approximately \( 3086 \).

To find the least width of the grating, we need to find \( N \):

\[
R = mN \implies N = \frac{R}{m} = \frac{5893/6}{2}

Calculate \( N \):

\[
N = \frac{5893}{12} \approx 491.08

Since \( N \) must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number:

\[
N = 492
\]

The width \( W \) of the grating is given by:

\[
W = \frac{N}{\text{number of lines per cm}} = \frac{492}{800} \, \text{cm}

Calculate \( W \):

\[
W = 0.615 \, \text{cm}

The refractive indices of a glass prism for the C and F lines are 1.6545 and 1.6635, respectively. The wavelengths of these two lines in the solar spectrum are \SI{6563}{\angstrom} and \SI{5270}{\angstrom}, respectively. Calculate the length of the base of a \SI{60}{\degree} prism which is capable of resolving sodium lines of wavelengths \SI{5890}{\angstrom} and \SI{5896}{\angstrom}.

\section*{Solution}

The resolving power \( R \) of a prism is given by:
\[
R = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{d n}{d \lambda} \cdot L
\]
where \( \Delta \lambda = \lambda_2 - \lambda_1 \) is the difference in wavelengths of the sodium lines, \( \lambda \) is the average wavelength, \( \frac{d n}{d \lambda} \) is the dispersion of the prism, and \( L \) is the base length of the prism.

Given:
\begin{align*}
n_C &= 1.6545, \\
n_F &= 1.6635, \\
\lambda_C &= \SI{6563}{\angstrom}, \\
\lambda_F &= \SI{5270}{\angstrom}, \\
\lambda_1 &= \SI{5890}{\angstrom}, \\
\lambda_2 &= \SI{5896}{\angstrom}.
\end{align*}

First, calculate the dispersion \( \frac{d n}{d \lambda} \):
\[
\frac{d n}{d \lambda} = \frac{n_F - n_C}{\lambda_F - \lambda_C} = \frac{1.6635 - 1.6545}{5270 - 6563} = \frac{0.0090}{-1293} \approx -6.96 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{\angstrom}^{-1}
\]

Calculate \( \Delta \lambda \) and \( \lambda \):
\[
\Delta \lambda = \lambda_2 - \lambda_1 = 5896 - 5890 = \SI{6}{\angstrom}
\]
\[
\lambda = \frac{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}{2} = \frac{5890 + 5896}{2} = \SI{5893}{\angstrom}
\]

Now, calculate the resolving power \( R \):
\[
R = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{6}{5893} \approx 0.001018
\]

Finally, solve for the base length \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{R}{\left| \frac{d n}{d \lambda} \right|} = \frac{0.001018}{6.96 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 146.26 \, \text{cm}

Thus, the length of the base of the prism required to resolve the sodium lines is approximately \SI{146.26}{\centi\meter}.

\section*{Resolution of Two Points on the Moon}

To find the separation of two points on the moon that can be resolved by a 500 cm telescope, we use the Rayleigh criterion for angular resolution:

\[
\theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\theta\) is the angular resolution in radians,
    \item \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of light,
    \item \(D\) is the diameter of the telescope.
\end{itemize}

Given:
\begin{align*}
    \lambda &= 5500 \, \text{\AA} = 5500 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}, \\
    D &= 500 \, \text{cm} = 5 \, \text{m}, \\
    L &= 3.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{km} = 3.8 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}.
\end{align*}

First, calculate the angular resolution \(\theta\):

\[
\theta = 1.22 \frac{5500 \times 10^{-10}}{5} = 1.22 \times 1100 \times 10^{-10} = 1.342 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{radians}
\]

The linear separation \(s\) on the moon that can be resolved is given by:

\[
s = L \cdot \theta
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
s = 3.8 \times 10^8 \times 1.342 \times 10^{-6} \approx 509.96 \, \text{m}
\]

Therefore, the separation of two points on the moon that can be resolved by the telescope is approximately \(510 \, \text{m}\).

15.62,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the angular position of the first diffraction maximum in a circular aperture, which is given by:

Lycopodium particles that have an average diameter of 30µm are dusted on a glass plate. If a parallel beam of light of wavelength 589 nm is passed through the plate, what is the angular radius of the first diffraction maximum? [Kakatiya University 2004]

\section*{Solution}

To find the angular radius of the first diffraction maximum, we use the formula for diffraction through a circular aperture:

\[

\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\theta\) is the angular radius of the first diffraction maximum,

The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction of a circular aperture of radius $R$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
    I = I_0 \left[ \frac{2J_1(\rho)}{\rho} \right]^2
\end{equation}

where $\rho = \frac{2\pi a}{\lambda} \sin \theta$ and $J_1(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind.

To determine the minimum angular resolution of a telescope using Rayleigh's criterion, we consider the first minimum of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$. The first zero of $J_1(x)$ occurs at $x \approx 3.8317$. Therefore, setting $\rho = 3.8317$, we have:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{2\pi a}{\lambda} \sin \theta = 3.8317
\end{equation}

Assuming small angles, $\sin \theta \approx \theta$, we can solve for $\theta$:

\begin{equation}
    \theta \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a}
\end{equation}

For a circular aperture, the radius $a$ is related to the diameter $D$ by $a = \frac{D}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:

\begin{equation}
    \theta \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{\pi D}
\end{equation}

Approximating $3.8317/\pi \approx 1.22$, we obtain Rayleigh's criterion for the minimum angular resolution:

\begin{equation}

- Wavelength, \( \lambda = 5000 \, \text{Å} = 5000 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)

We need to calculate the radii for the 1st and 25th zones.

1. **Radius of the 1st zone (\( n = 1 \)):**

\[
r_1 = \sqrt{1 \times 5000 \times 10^{-10} \times 50 \times 10^{-2}}

\[

Simplifying further:

\[
\Delta\phi = \frac{2\pi}{6000 \times 10^{-10}} \times 0.164 \times 0.04 \times 10^{-3}

\[
\Delta\phi = \frac{2\pi \times 0.164 \times 0.04 \times 10^{-3}}{6000 \times 10^{-10}}

\[
\Delta\phi = \frac{2\pi \times 0.164 \times 0.04}{6000 \times 10^{-7}}

Finally, calculate the numerical value:

\[
\Delta\phi \approx \frac{2\pi \times 0.00656}{6000 \times 10^{-7}}

    \item $\theta = 13.2^\circ$ is the observed angle of rotation,

    \item $c$ is the concentration of the sugar solution in grams per deciliter (g/dL).

Substituting the given values:

\[
c = \frac{13.2}{13.2} = 1 \, \text{g/dL}

Since the solution is 1 g/dL, the amount of sugar in a litre (10 dL) of the solution is:

\[
\text{Amount of sugar} = 1 \, \text{g/dL} \times 10 \, \text{dL} = 10 \, \text{g}

\section*{Problem}

A system of three polarizing sheets intercepts a beam of initially unpolarized light. The polarizing direction of the first sheet is parallel to the $y$-axis, that of the second sheet is at an angle of $\theta$ counterclockwise from the $y$-axis, and that of the third sheet is parallel to the $x$-axis. The intensity of light emerging from the three-sheet system is 11.52\% of the original intensity $I_0$. Determine the angle $\theta$. In which direction is the emerging light polarized?

\section*{Solution}

The intensity of light after passing through the first polarizer is given by:

\[
I_1 = \frac{1}{2} I_0
\]

This is because the first polarizer reduces the intensity of the unpolarized light by half.

After passing through the second polarizer, the intensity is:

\[
I_2 = I_1 \cos^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} I_0 \cos^2 \theta
\]

Finally, after passing through the third polarizer, which is oriented at $90^\circ$ to the first polarizer, the intensity is:

\[
I_3 = I_2 \cos^2 (90^\circ - \theta) = \frac{1}{2} I_0 \cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta
\]

Given that the final intensity $I_3$ is 11.52\% of the original intensity $I_0$, we have:

\[
I_3 = 0.1152 I_0
\]

Substituting the expression for $I_3$, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2} I_0 \cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta = 0.1152 I_0
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
\cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta = 0.2304
\]

Using the identity $\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta$, we can express $\sin^2 \theta$ in terms of $\cos^2 \theta$:

\[
\cos^2 \theta (1 - \cos^2 \theta) = 0.2304
\]

Let $x = \cos^2 \theta$. Then the equation becomes:

\[
x (1 - x) = 0.2304
\]

\[
x - x^2 = 0.2304
\]

\[
x^2 - x + 0.2304 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 0.2304$, we find:

\[
x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4 \times 0.2304}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{0.0784}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{1 \pm 0.28}{2}
\]

Thus, $x = 0.64$ or $x = 0.36$. Since $x = \cos^2 \theta$, we have $\cos \theta = \sqrt{0.64} = 0.8$ or $\cos \theta = \sqrt{0.36} = 0.6$.

Therefore, $\theta = \cos^{-1}(0.8) \approx 36.87^\circ$ or $\theta = \cos^{-1}(0.6) \approx 53.13^\circ$.

Since the problem states the emerging light is polarized along the $x$-axis, we choose $\theta = 53.13^\circ$.

Thus, the angle $\theta$ is approximately $53.13^\circ$, and the emerging light is polarized along the $x$-axis.

\section*{Polarization and Brewster's Angle}

\subsection*{Linear Polarizer and Polarized Light}

A linear polarizer produces polarized light from an incident unpolarized beam by allowing only the component of the electric field vector that is parallel to its transmission axis to pass through. The component of the electric field that is perpendicular to the transmission axis is absorbed or reflected. As a result, the emerging light is linearly polarized along the direction of the transmission axis.

\subsection*{Orientation of Polaroid Sunglasses}

The transmission axis of a pair of polaroid sunglasses is usually oriented vertically for an observer standing upright. This orientation is chosen because most of the glare from horizontal surfaces, such as roads and water bodies, is horizontally polarized. By aligning the transmission axis vertically, the sunglasses effectively block this horizontally polarized glare, improving visual comfort and clarity.

\subsection*{Brewster Window}

A Brewster window is an optical window that is oriented at Brewster's angle to minimize reflection losses for p-polarized light (light polarized in the plane of incidence). At Brewster's angle, the reflected light is entirely s-polarized, and there is no reflection of p-polarized light.

\subsection*{Calculation of Brewster's Angle}

To calculate the inclination of a Brewster window, we use the formula for Brewster's angle, $\theta_B$, given by:

\[
\tan \theta_B = \frac{n_2}{n_1}
\]

where $n_1$ is the refractive index of the initial medium (gas medium with $n_1 = 1.0$) and $n_2$ is the refractive index of the second medium (the Brewster window with $n_2 = 1.5$).

\[
\tan \theta_B = \frac{1.5}{1.0} = 1.5
\]

Thus, the Brewster angle $\theta_B$ is:

\[
\theta_B = \tan^{-1}(1.5)
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\theta_B \approx 56.31^\circ
\]

Therefore, the inclination of the Brewster window is approximately $56.31^\circ$.
