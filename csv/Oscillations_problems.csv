\section*{Problem Statement}

The total energy of a particle executing simple harmonic motion (SHM) with a period of $2\pi$ seconds is $256 \, \text{J}$. The displacement of the particle at $t = \frac{\pi}{4} \, \text{s}$ is $8\sqrt{2} \, \text{cm}$. Calculate the amplitude of motion and the mass of the particle.

\section*{Solution}

The total energy \( E \) of a particle in SHM is given by:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 A^2
\]
where \( m \) is the mass of the particle, \( \omega \) is the angular frequency, and \( A \) is the amplitude.

Given:
\[
E = 256 \, \text{J}
\]
\[
T = 2\pi \, \text{s} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{2\pi}{2\pi} = 1 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

The displacement \( x \) at time \( t = \frac{\pi}{4} \, \text{s} \) is:
\[
x = 8\sqrt{2} \, \text{cm} = 0.08\sqrt{2} \, \text{m}
\]

The displacement in SHM is given by:
\[
x = A \cos(\omega t)
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
0.08\sqrt{2} = A \cos\left(1 \times \frac{\pi}{4}\right)
\]
\[
0.08\sqrt{2} = A \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
\[
A = 0.08 \times 2 = 0.16 \, \text{m}
\]

Substituting \( A \) and \( \omega \) back into the energy equation:
\[
256 = \frac{1}{2} m \cdot 1^2 \cdot (0.16)^2
\]
\[
256 = \frac{1}{2} m \cdot 0.0256
\]
\[
m = \frac{256 \times 2}{0.0256} = 20000 \, \text{kg}
\]

Thus, the amplitude of motion is \( 0.16 \, \text{m} \) and the mass of the particle is \( 20000 \, \text{kg} \).

6.5,"To show that a floating body performs simple harmonic motion when given a small vertical displacement from its equilibrium position, we start by considering the buoyant force acting on the body. According to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid.

Let's denote:
- \( V \) as the volume of displaced liquid,
- \( A \) as the area of the plane of flotation,
- \( \rho \) as the density of the liquid,
- \( g \) as the acceleration due to gravity,
- \( \Delta x \) as the small vertical displacement from equilibrium.

The buoyant force \( F_b \) can be expressed as:

\[
F_b = \rho g (V + A \Delta x)
\]

At equilibrium, the buoyant force equals the weight of the body, so:

\[
\rho g V = mg
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the body. When displaced by \( \Delta x \), the net restoring force \( F \) acting on the body is:

\[
F = \rho g (V + A \Delta x) - mg = \rho g A \Delta x
\]

This restoring force is proportional to the displacement \( \Delta x \), indicating simple harmonic motion. The equation of motion is:

\[
m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\rho g A x
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \left(\frac{\rho g A}{m}\right) x = 0
\]

The angular frequency \( \omega \) of the simple harmonic motion is given by:

\[
\omega^2 = \frac{\rho g A}{m}
\]

Since \( \rho g V = mg \), we have \( m = \rho V \). Substituting this into the expression for \( \omega^2 \), we get:

\[
\omega^2 = \frac{\rho g A}{\rho V} = \frac{g A}{V}
\]

Thus, the angular frequency \( \omega \) is:

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g A}{V}}
\]

The period \( T \) of the simple harmonic motion is:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{V}{g A}}
\]

Therefore, the period of the simple harmonic motion is \( 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{V}{g A}} \), as required. This completes the demonstration that the floating body performs simple harmonic motion with the given period."

\title{Simple Harmonic Motion in a Tunnel through the Earth}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}
Imagine a tunnel bored along the diameter of the Earth, which is assumed to have constant density. A box is thrown into the tunnel (chute).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Show that the box executes simple harmonic motion (SHM) inside the tunnel about the center of the Earth.
    \item[(b)] Find the time period of oscillations.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Simple Harmonic Motion}

Assume the Earth is a sphere with radius $R$ and constant density $\rho$. The gravitational force inside the Earth at a distance $r$ from the center is given by:

\[
F = -\frac{G M(r) m}{r^2}
\]

where $M(r)$ is the mass enclosed within radius $r$, $m$ is the mass of the box, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. Since the Earth has constant density, we have:

\[
M(r) = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

The gravitational force becomes:

\[
F = -\frac{G (\rho \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3) m}{r^2} = -\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho m r
\]

This force is proportional to $r$ and directed towards the center, indicating simple harmonic motion. The equation of motion is:

\[
m \frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = -\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho m r
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = -\omega^2 r
\]

where $\omega^2 = \frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho$. This is the standard form of the equation for SHM.

\subsection*{(b) Time Period of Oscillations}

The angular frequency $\omega$ is related to the time period $T$ by:

\[
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}
\]

Thus, the time period $T$ is:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{1}{\omega^2}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{3}{4 \pi G \rho}}
\]

Given that the Earth has a mean density $\rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3}$, where $M$ is the mass of the Earth and $R$ is its radius, we can substitute:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{3 R^3}{G M}}
\]

This is the time period of oscillations for the box executing SHM inside the tunnel through the Earth.

A particle which executes Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) along a straight line has its motion represented by the equation:

6.8,"To convert the given physics text into properly formatted LaTeX, we will use the equations for simple harmonic motion (SHM) and the relationships between kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE). Here is the LaTeX code:

\section*{Simple Harmonic Motion: Energy Relations}

\subsection*{(a) Distance from Equilibrium where Kinetic Energy equals Potential Energy}

In simple harmonic motion (SHM), the total mechanical energy \( E \) is the sum of kinetic energy \( KE \) and potential energy \( PE \). It is given by:

\[
E = KE + PE = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 A^2
\]

where \( m \) is the mass, \( \omega \) is the angular frequency, and \( A \) is the amplitude.

The kinetic energy is given by:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 (A^2 - x^2)
\]

The potential energy is given by:

\[
PE = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2
\]

To find the distance \( x \) from the equilibrium position where \( KE = PE \), we set:

\[
\frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 (A^2 - x^2) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
A^2 - x^2 = x^2
\]

\[
A^2 = 2x^2
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{A^2}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{A}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Thus, the distance from the equilibrium position where the kinetic energy equals the potential energy is \( \frac{A}{\sqrt{2}} \).

\subsection*{(b) Ratio of Kinetic Energy to Potential Energy when Displacement is Half of the Amplitude}

If the displacement \( x \) is one-half of the amplitude, i.e., \( x = \frac{A}{2} \), then the potential energy is:

\[
PE = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 \left(\frac{A}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 \frac{A^2}{4} = \frac{1}{8} m \omega^2 A^2
\]

The total energy is:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 A^2
\]

The kinetic energy is:

\[
KE = E - PE = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 A^2 - \frac{1}{8} m \omega^2 A^2 = \frac{4}{8} m \omega^2 A^2 - \frac{1}{8} m \omega^2 A^2 = \frac{3}{8} m \omega^2 A^2
\]

Therefore, the ratio of kinetic energy to potential energy is:

\[
\frac{KE}{PE} = \frac{\frac{3}{8} m \omega^2 A^2}{\frac{1}{8} m \omega^2 A^2} = 3:1
\]

Thus, when the displacement is one-half of the amplitude, the kinetic energy and potential energy are in the ratio 3:1.

This LaTeX document provides a clear and structured presentation of the problem and its solution, using the appropriate equations for SHM."
6.9,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the period of a mass-spring system, which is given by:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
\]

where \( T \) is the period, \( m \) is the mass, and \( k \) is the spring constant. We are given two scenarios:

1. The initial period \( T_1 = 2 \, \text{s} \) with mass \( m = M \).
2. The new period \( T_2 = 3 \, \text{s} \) with mass \( m = M + 2 \, \text{kg} \).

Using the formula for the period, we can write two equations:

\[
T_1 = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{M}{k}} = 2
\]

\[
T_2 = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{M + 2}{k}} = 3
\]

We can solve these equations to find the initial mass \( M \).

First, solve for \( k \) from the first equation:

\[
2 = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{M}{k}} \implies \sqrt{\frac{M}{k}} = \frac{1}{\pi} \implies \frac{M}{k} = \frac{1}{\pi^2} \implies k = \frac{\pi^2 M}{1}
\]

Substitute \( k \) into the second equation:

\[
3 = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{M + 2}{\frac{\pi^2 M}{1}}} \implies \sqrt{\frac{M + 2}{M}} = \frac{3}{2\pi}
\]

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{M + 2}{M} = \left(\frac{3}{2\pi}\right)^2
\]

Simplify and solve for \( M \):

\[
M + 2 = M \cdot \frac{9}{4\pi^2}
\]

\[
M + 2 = \frac{9M}{4\pi^2}
\]

\[
4\pi^2(M + 2) = 9M
\]

\[
4\pi^2M + 8\pi^2 = 9M
\]

\[
8\pi^2 = 9M - 4\pi^2M
\]

\[
8\pi^2 = M(9 - 4\pi^2)
\]

\[
M = \frac{8\pi^2}{9 - 4\pi^2}
\]

Thus, the initial mass \( M \) is:

\[
M = \frac{8\pi^2}{9 - 4\pi^2}
\]

This is the expression for the initial mass \( M \) in terms of \(\pi\)."

If the maximum acceleration of a simple harmonic motion (SHM) is $\alpha$ and the maximum velocity is $\beta$, show that the amplitude of vibration is given by $\frac{\beta^2}{\alpha}$ and the period of oscillation by $\frac{2\pi\beta}{\alpha}$.

\section*{Solution}

In simple harmonic motion, the maximum acceleration $a_{\text{max}}$ is given by:
\[
a_{\text{max}} = \omega^2 A
\]
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency and $A$ is the amplitude.

The maximum velocity $v_{\text{max}}$ is given by:
\[
v_{\text{max}} = \omega A
\]

Given that $a_{\text{max}} = \alpha$ and $v_{\text{max}} = \beta$, we can write:
\[
\alpha = \omega^2 A
\]
\[
\beta = \omega A
\]

Solving for $A$ in terms of $\beta$ and $\alpha$, we have:
\[
A = \frac{\beta}{\omega}
\]

Substituting $\omega = \frac{\beta}{A}$ into the equation for $\alpha$, we get:
\[
\alpha = \left(\frac{\beta}{A}\right)^2 A = \frac{\beta^2}{A}
\]

Rearranging for $A$, we find:
\[
A = \frac{\beta^2}{\alpha}
\]

Thus, the amplitude of vibration is given by $\frac{\beta^2}{\alpha}$.

For the period $T$ of oscillation, we use the relation:
\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
\]

Substituting $\omega = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}$ (from $\alpha = \omega^2 A$ and $\beta = \omega A$), we have:
\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\frac{\alpha}{\beta}} = \frac{2\pi\beta}{\alpha}
\]

Thus, the period of oscillation is given by $\frac{2\pi\beta}{\alpha}$.

A 4 kg mass at the end of a spring moves with Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) on a horizontal frictionless table with period 2 s and amplitude 2 m. Determine:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The spring constant, \( k \).
    \item The maximum force exerted on the spring.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Spring Constant}

The period \( T \) of a mass-spring system in SHM is given by the formula:
\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
\]
where \( m = 4 \, \text{kg} \) is the mass and \( k \) is the spring constant. Rearranging the formula to solve for \( k \), we have:
\[
k = \frac{4\pi^2 m}{T^2}
\]

Substituting the given values \( T = 2 \, \text{s} \) and \( m = 4 \, \text{kg} \):
\[
k = \frac{4\pi^2 \times 4}{2^2} = \frac{16\pi^2}{4} = 4\pi^2 \, \text{N/m}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Maximum Force Exerted on the Spring}

The maximum force exerted on the spring, \( F_{\text{max}} \), occurs at the maximum displacement (amplitude) and is given by Hooke's Law:
\[
F_{\text{max}} = k \cdot A
\]
where \( A = 2 \, \text{m} \) is the amplitude.

Using the spring constant calculated in part (a):
\[
F_{\text{max}} = 4\pi^2 \times 2 = 8\pi^2 \, \text{N}

Thus, the maximum force exerted on the spring is \( 8\pi^2 \, \text{N} \).

A particle moves in the \( xy \)-plane according to the equations \( x = a \sin \omega t \) and \( y = b \cos \omega t \). Determine the path of the particle.

\section*{Solution}

The equations of motion for the particle are given by:
\[
x = a \sin \omega t
\]
\[
y = b \cos \omega t
\]

To find the path of the particle, we need to eliminate the parameter \( t \). We start by expressing \( \sin \omega t \) and \( \cos \omega t \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
\sin \omega t = \frac{x}{a}
\]
\[
\cos \omega t = \frac{y}{b}
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity \( \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 \), we substitute the expressions for \( \sin \omega t \) and \( \cos \omega t \):

\[
\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 = 1

This simplifies to the equation of an ellipse:
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1

\section*{Problem}

(a) Prove that the force $\mathbf{F} = -k x \hat{\mathbf{i}}$ acting in a Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) is conservative.

(b) Find the potential energy of an SHO.

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Proving the Force is Conservative}

A force is conservative if it can be expressed as the negative gradient of a potential energy function $U(x)$, i.e.,

\[
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla U(x).
\]

For the given force $\mathbf{F} = -k x \hat{\mathbf{i}}$, we need to check if there exists a potential energy function $U(x)$ such that

\[
-k x \hat{\mathbf{i}} = -\frac{dU}{dx} \hat{\mathbf{i}}.
\]

This implies

\[
\frac{dU}{dx} = kx.
\]

Integrating both sides with respect to $x$, we obtain

\[
U(x) = \int kx \, dx = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 + C,
\]

where $C$ is the constant of integration. Since the force can be derived from a potential energy function, it is conservative.

\subsection*{(b) Finding the Potential Energy}

From the integration above, we have found that the potential energy $U(x)$ of a Simple Harmonic Oscillator is given by

\[
U(x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 + C.
\]

Typically, the constant $C$ is chosen to be zero for convenience, giving us

\[
U(x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2.
\]

Thus, the potential energy of a Simple Harmonic Oscillator is $U(x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$.

A 2 kg weight is placed on a vertical spring, stretching it 5 cm. The weight is pulled down a distance of 10 cm and released. Find (a) the spring constant; (b) the amplitude; (c) the frequency of oscillations.

\section*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] \textbf{Spring Constant, \( k \):}
    
    The spring constant \( k \) can be found using Hooke's Law:
    \[
    F = kx

    The displacement \( x \) is 5 cm or 0.05 m. Thus, the spring constant \( k \) is:
    \[
    k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{19.6 \, \text{N}}{0.05 \, \text{m}} = 392 \, \text{N/m}

    \item[(c)] \textbf{Frequency of Oscillations, \( f \):}
    
    The frequency of oscillations can be found using the formula:
    \[
    f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
    \]
    Substituting the known values:
    \[
    f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{392 \, \text{N/m}}{2 \, \text{kg}}} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{196} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \times 14

A mass $m$ is dropped from a height $h$ onto a scale-pan of negligible weight, suspended from a spring with spring constant $k$. The collision may be considered completely inelastic, meaning the mass sticks to the pan, and the pan begins to oscillate. Find the amplitude of the pan's oscillations.

\section*{Solution}

When the mass $m$ is dropped from height $h$, it has potential energy given by:
\[
E_{\text{potential}} = mgh
\]

Upon collision with the pan, this potential energy is converted into the mechanical energy of the spring system. Since the collision is completely inelastic, the kinetic energy just before the collision is converted into the potential energy of the spring at maximum compression (or extension), which corresponds to the amplitude of oscillation $A$.

The potential energy stored in the spring at maximum amplitude is:
\[
E_{\text{spring}} = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

By conservation of energy, the potential energy of the mass before the collision is equal to the potential energy of the spring at maximum amplitude:
\[
mgh = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Solving for $A$, the amplitude of oscillation, we get:
\[
A = \sqrt{\frac{2mgh}{k}}
\]

Thus, the amplitude of the pan's oscillations is given by:
\[
A = \sqrt{\frac{2mgh}{k}}
\]

A particle executes simple harmonic motion (SHM) along the $x$-axis according to the law $x = A \sin(\omega t)$. We want to find the probability $dp(x)$ of finding the particle between $x$ and $x + dx$.

\section*{Solution}

The probability density function for a particle in SHM can be derived from the time spent by the particle in a small interval $dx$. The time $dt$ spent in an interval $dx$ is inversely proportional to the velocity $v(x)$ of the particle at position $x$. 

The velocity $v(x)$ is given by:
\[
v(x) = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(A \sin(\omega t)) = A \omega \cos(\omega t)
\]

Using the identity $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$, we can express $\cos(\omega t)$ in terms of $x$:
\[
\cos(\omega t) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(\omega t)} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^2}
\]

Thus, the velocity becomes:
\[
v(x) = A \omega \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^2}
\]

The time $dt$ spent in the interval $dx$ is:
\[
dt = \frac{dx}{v(x)} = \frac{dx}{A \omega \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^2}}
\]

The probability $dp(x)$ is proportional to the time $dt$, so:
\[
dp(x) = C \cdot dt = C \cdot \frac{dx}{A \omega \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{x}{A}\right)^2}}
\]

where $C$ is a normalization constant determined by the condition that the total probability over one complete oscillation is 1. Integrating $dp(x)$ over the range $-A$ to $A$ gives:
\[
\int_{-A}^{A} dp(x) = 1
\]

Thus, the probability density function $p(x)$ is:
\[
p(x) = \frac{1}{\pi \sqrt{A^2 - x^2}}
\]

Therefore, the probability of finding the particle between $x$ and $x + dx$ is:
\[
dp(x) = \frac{dx}{\pi \sqrt{A^2 - x^2}}
\]

6.20,"To calculate the mean potential energy and the mean kinetic energy for a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) using the probability density distribution, we start by considering the wave function and the corresponding probability density. For a one-dimensional SHO, the wave function for the \(n\)-th energy level is given by:

\[
\psi_n(x) = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n n!}} \right) \left( \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \right)^{1/4} e^{-\alpha x^2/2} H_n(\sqrt{\alpha} x)
\]

where \( \alpha = \frac{m \omega}{\hbar} \), \( H_n \) is the Hermite polynomial of order \( n \), \( m \) is the mass, \( \omega \) is the angular frequency, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant.

The probability density is given by:

\[
P_n(x) = |\psi_n(x)|^2
\]

The mean potential energy \( \langle V \rangle \) is given by:

\[
\langle V \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} V(x) P_n(x) \, dx
\]

For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is \( V(x) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 \). Thus, the mean potential energy becomes:

\[
\langle V \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 |\psi_n(x)|^2 \, dx
\]

The mean kinetic energy \( \langle T \rangle \) is given by:

\[
\langle T \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \psi_n^*(x) \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \psi_n(x) \right) \, dx
\]

For a simple harmonic oscillator, it is known that:

\[
\langle T \rangle = \langle V \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar \omega (2n + 1)
\]

Thus, the total energy \( E_n \) for the \(n\)-th level is:

\[
E_n = \langle T \rangle + \langle V \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega (2n + 1) = \hbar \omega \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)

This shows that the mean potential energy and the mean kinetic energy are equal and each is half of the total energy for a given energy level \( n \)."

\section*{Problem Statement}

A cylinder of mass $m$ is allowed to roll on a smooth horizontal table with a spring of spring constant $k$ attached to it so that it executes simple harmonic motion (SHM) about the equilibrium position. Find the time period of oscillations.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we consider the forces and torques acting on the cylinder. The cylinder rolls without slipping, so the translational and rotational motions are coupled.

The force exerted by the spring is given by Hooke's law:
\[
F = -kx
\]
where $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

For a rolling cylinder, the relationship between linear acceleration $a$ and angular acceleration $\alpha$ is:
\[
a = R\alpha
\]
where $R$ is the radius of the cylinder.

The moment of inertia $I$ of a solid cylinder about its axis is:
\[
I = \frac{1}{2}mR^2
\]

The torque $\tau$ due to the spring force is:
\[
\tau = -kxR
\]

Using Newton's second law for rotation, we have:
\[
\tau = I\alpha
\]

Substituting the expressions for $\tau$ and $\alpha$, we get:
\[
-kxR = \frac{1}{2}mR^2 \cdot \frac{a}{R}
\]

Simplifying, we find:
\[
-kx = \frac{1}{2}ma
\]

Since $a = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$, we can write:
\[
-kx = \frac{1}{2}m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}
\]

Rearranging gives the differential equation for SHM:
\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \frac{2k}{m}x = 0
\]

The angular frequency $\omega$ is given by:
\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}}
\]

The time period $T$ of the oscillations is:
\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{2k}}
\]

Thus, the time period of oscillations is:
\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{2k}}
\]

6.22,"To solve this problem, we need to find the time taken for one pendulum to gain a complete oscillation over the other. This is a classic problem involving the concept of ""beats"" in oscillations.

The time period \( T \) of a simple pendulum is given by:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
\]

where \( L \) is the length of the pendulum and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

Let's denote:
- \( L_1 = 60 \, \text{cm} = 0.60 \, \text{m} \)
- \( L_2 = 63 \, \text{cm} = 0.63 \, \text{m} \)

The time periods for the two pendulums are:

\[
T_1 = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L_1}{g}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{0.60}{g}}
\]

\[
T_2 = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L_2}{g}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{0.63}{g}}
\]

The time taken for one pendulum to gain a complete oscillation over the other is the beat period \( T_{\text{beat}} \), given by the difference in their time periods:

\[
T_{\text{beat}} = \left| \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \right|^{-1}
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \):

\[
T_{\text{beat}} = \left| \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{\frac{0.60}{g}}} - \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{\frac{0.63}{g}}} \right|^{-1}
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
T_{\text{beat}} = \left| \frac{\sqrt{g}}{2\pi} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.60}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.63}} \right) \right|^{-1}
\]

\[
T_{\text{beat}} = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{g}} \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.60}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.63}} \right|^{-1}
\]

Finally, substituting \( g \approx 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):

\[
T_{\text{beat}} = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{9.81}} \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.60}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.63}} \right|^{-1}

Calculating this gives the time taken for one pendulum to gain a complete oscillation over the other."
6.23,"To solve this problem, we need to consider the change in gravitational acceleration when the pendulum is moved from the ground to the top of the tower. The gravitational acceleration \( g \) at a height \( h \) above the Earth's surface is given by:

\[
g' = g \left(1 - \frac{2h}{R}\right)
\]

where:
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface,
- \( h = 320 \, \text{m} \) is the height of the tower,
- \( R = 6400 \, \text{km} = 6400 \times 10^3 \, \text{m} \) is the radius of the Earth.

The period of a pendulum is given by:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
\]

where \( L \) is the length of the pendulum. At the top of the tower, the period becomes:

\[
T' = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g'}}
\]

The change in period \( \Delta T \) is:

\[
\Delta T = T' - T = 2\pi \left(\sqrt{\frac{L}{g'}} - \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}\right)
\]

Using the approximation for small \( x \), \( \sqrt{1 - x} \approx 1 - \frac{x}{2} \), we have:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{L}{g'}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \left(1 + \frac{h}{R}\right)
\]

Thus, the change in period is approximately:

\[
\Delta T \approx 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \cdot \frac{h}{2R}
\]

The time lost per oscillation is \( \Delta T \), and the total time lost in one day (86400 seconds) is:

\[
\Delta t = \frac{\Delta T}{T} \times 86400
\]

Substituting \( T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \), we find:

\[
\Delta t = \frac{h}{2R} \times 86400
\]

Finally, substituting the given values:

\[
\Delta t = \frac{320}{2 \times 6400 \times 10^3} \times 86400
\]

Calculating this gives the total time lost in one day."

\]

where the time period \( \tau \) is 24 seconds. At \( t = 0 \), the displacement is 4 cm. We need to find the displacement at \( t = 6 \) seconds.

First, we determine the phase constant \( \phi \) using the initial condition:

Thus, \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{6} \) or \( \phi = \frac{5\pi}{6} \).

\[
y(6) = 8 \sin\left( \frac{2\pi \times 6}{24} + \frac{\pi}{6} \right)

\begin{document}

\section*{Problem}
A semi-circular homogeneous disc of radius $R$ and mass $m$ is pivoted freely about the center. If slightly tilted through a small angle and released, find the angular frequency of oscillations.

\section*{Solution}
To find the angular frequency of oscillations, we start by considering the torque $\tau$ acting on the disc when it is tilted by a small angle $\theta$. The gravitational force acts through the center of mass of the semi-circular disc, which is located at a distance $\frac{4R}{3\pi}$ from the pivot point (the center of the disc).

The torque due to gravity is given by:
\[
\tau = -mg \left(\frac{4R}{3\pi}\right) \sin\theta
\]

For small angles, $\sin\theta \approx \theta$, so:
\[
\tau \approx -mg \left(\frac{4R}{3\pi}\right) \theta
\]

The moment of inertia $I$ of a semi-circular disc about its center is:
\[
I = \frac{1}{2} m R^2
\]

Using the equation of motion for rotational systems, $\tau = I \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration, we have:
\[
-mg \left(\frac{4R}{3\pi}\right) \theta = \frac{1}{2} m R^2 \alpha
\]

Solving for $\alpha$, we get:
\[
\alpha = -\frac{2g}{R} \left(\frac{4R}{3\pi}\right) \theta = -\frac{8g}{3\pi R} \theta
\]

This is a simple harmonic motion equation of the form $\alpha = -\omega^2 \theta$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency. Thus:
\[
\omega^2 = \frac{8g}{3\pi R}
\]

The angular frequency $\omega$ is:
\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{8g}{3\pi R}}

Therefore, the angular frequency of oscillations is:
\[
\boxed{\omega = \sqrt{\frac{8g}{3\pi R}}}

In the arrangement shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:system}, the radius of the pulley is $r$, its moment of inertia about the rotation axis is $I$, and $k$ is the spring constant. Assuming that the mass of the thread and the spring is negligible and that the thread does not slide over the frictionless pulley, calculate the angular frequency of small oscillations.

    \caption{Pulley and spring system}
    \label{fig:system}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

To find the angular frequency of small oscillations, we start by considering the torque $\tau$ acting on the pulley due to the spring force. The spring force $F$ is given by Hooke's law:

\begin{equation}
    F = -kx,
\end{equation}

where $x$ is the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position.

The torque $\tau$ on the pulley is then:

\begin{equation}
    \tau = rF = -krx.
\end{equation}

According to Newton's second law for rotation, the torque is also related to the angular acceleration $\alpha$ by:

\begin{equation}
    \tau = I\alpha.
\end{equation}

For small oscillations, the angular displacement $\theta$ is related to the linear displacement $x$ by $x = r\theta$. Thus, the angular acceleration $\alpha$ is:

\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}.
\end{equation}

Substituting the expressions for $\tau$ and $\alpha$, we get:

\begin{equation}
    -kr^2\theta = I\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}.
\end{equation}

This can be rearranged to the form of a simple harmonic oscillator:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{kr^2}{I}\theta = 0.
\end{equation}

The angular frequency $\omega$ of the oscillations is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \omega = \sqrt{\frac{kr^2}{I}}.
\end{equation}

Thus, the angular frequency of small oscillations is:

\begin{equation}
    \boxed{\omega = \sqrt{\frac{kr^2}{I}}}

\[ T = 4\pi \sqrt{\frac{2a^3 m}{b^4}} \]
\emph{[Osmania University 1999]}

\section*{Solution}

The potential energy function is given by:
\[
U(x) = ax^2 - bx
\]

To find the equilibrium position, we set the derivative of the potential energy with respect to $x$ to zero:
\[
\frac{dU}{dx} = 2ax - b = 0
\]

Solving for $x$, we find the equilibrium position $x_0$:
\[
x_0 = \frac{b}{2a}
\]

For small oscillations around the equilibrium position, we consider the second derivative of the potential energy to find the effective spring constant $k$:
\[
\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 2a
\]

The effective spring constant is $k = 2a$. The angular frequency $\omega$ for small oscillations is given by:
\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2a}{m}}
\]

The period $T$ of the oscillations is:
\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{2a}}
\]

However, we need to find the period in terms of the given parameters. By considering the potential energy and the equilibrium position, we can express the period as:
\[
T = 4\pi \sqrt{\frac{2a^3 m}{b^4}}
\]

Thus, the period of small oscillations about the equilibrium position is:
\[
T = 4\pi \sqrt{\frac{2a^3 m}{b^4}}

\section*{Solution}

When two springs are connected in series, the effective spring constant $k_{\text{eff}}$ can be calculated using the formula:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{k_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2}
\end{equation}

Solving for $k_{\text{eff}}$, we get:

\begin{equation}
    k_{\text{eff}} = \frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}
\end{equation}

Thus, the effective spring constant for the two springs connected in series is given by the above expression.

A mass $m$ is connected to two springs with spring constants $k_1$ and $k_2$ in parallel, as shown in Fig. 6.13. Calculate the effective (equivalent) spring constant.

When two springs are connected in parallel, the effective spring constant $k_{\text{eff}}$ is the sum of the individual spring constants. Therefore, the effective spring constant is given by:

\begin{equation}
    k_{\text{eff}} = k_1 + k_2

\title{Physics Problem: Oscillation of a Mass on a Frictionless Table}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

A mass $m$ is placed on a frictionless horizontal table and is connected to fixed points $A$ and $B$ by two springs of negligible mass and of equal natural length with spring constants $k_1$ and $k_2$, as shown in Fig. 6.14. The mass is displaced along the $x$-axis and released. Calculate the period of oscillation.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig6_14.png} % Placeholder for Fig. 6.14
\end{center}

\section*{Solution}

When the mass is displaced by a small distance $x$ along the $x$-axis, the restoring force due to the springs is given by Hooke's law:

\[
F = -k_1 x - k_2 x = -(k_1 + k_2)x
\]

This force leads to simple harmonic motion, where the equation of motion is:

\[
m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -(k_1 + k_2)x
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \frac{k_1 + k_2}{m} x = 0
\]

The angular frequency $\omega$ of the oscillation is given by:

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k_1 + k_2}{m}}
\]

The period of oscillation $T$ is related to the angular frequency by:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k_1 + k_2}}
\]

Thus, the period of oscillation is:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k_1 + k_2}}

\section*{Problem Statement}

A mass $m$ is attached to one end of a weightless stiff rod, which is rigidly connected to the center of a uniform cylinder of radius $R$, as shown in Fig. 6.15. Assuming that the cylinder rolls without slipping, calculate the natural frequency of oscillation of the system.

    \label{fig:6_15}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

To find the natural frequency of oscillation, we start by considering the dynamics of the system. The cylinder rolls without slipping, which implies a relationship between the translational and rotational motions.

The moment of inertia of the cylinder about its center is given by:
\[
I = \frac{1}{2} m_c R^2
\]
where $m_c$ is the mass of the cylinder.

The equation of motion for the system can be derived using the principle of conservation of energy or by applying Newton's second law. Assuming small oscillations, the system behaves like a simple harmonic oscillator.

The natural frequency $\omega_n$ can be expressed as:
\[
\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{k_{\text{eff}}}{m_{\text{eff}}}}
\]
where $k_{\text{eff}}$ is the effective spring constant and $m_{\text{eff}}$ is the effective mass of the system.

For detailed calculations, consider the forces and torques acting on the system, and apply the conditions for rolling without slipping. This will lead to the expression for the natural frequency.

\begin{document}

\section*{Problem Statement}
Find the natural frequency of a semi-circular disc of mass $m$ and radius $r$ which rolls from side to side without slipping.

\section*{Solution}
To solve this problem, we need to consider the dynamics of a semi-circular disc rolling about its center of mass. The moment of inertia $I$ of a semi-circular disc about an axis through its center of mass perpendicular to the plane is given by:
\[
I = \frac{1}{2} m r^2
\]

When the disc rolls from side to side, it undergoes small angular displacements. The restoring torque $\tau$ due to gravity for a small angle $\theta$ is:
\[
\tau = -m g \cdot r \cdot \sin(\theta) \approx -m g r \theta
\]

Using the equation for rotational motion, $\tau = I \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration, we have:
\[
-m g r \theta = \frac{1}{2} m r^2 \cdot \frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2}
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} + \frac{2g}{r} \theta = 0
\]

This is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency $\omega$ given by:
\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{2g}{r}}
\]

Therefore, the natural frequency $f$ is:
\[
f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{2g}{r}}

Thus, the natural frequency of the semi-circular disc is:

f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{2g}{r}}

\begin{equation}
    \ddot{q}_i + \omega_i^2 q_i = 0,

Normal coordinates have the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They decouple the equations of motion, allowing each normal coordinate to oscillate independently.
    \item Each normal coordinate corresponds to a normal mode of the system, characterized by a specific frequency \( \omega_i \).

\section*{Problem}

The superposition of two harmonic oscillations in the same direction leads to the resultant displacement:
\[
y = A \cos(6\pi t) \sin(90\pi t),
\]
where \( t \) is expressed in seconds. Find the frequency of the component vibrations and the beat frequency.

\section*{Solution}

The given expression for the displacement is:
\[
y = A \cos(6\pi t) \sin(90\pi t).
\]

Using the trigonometric identity for the product of cosines and sines:
\[
\cos(a) \sin(b) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \sin(a+b) - \sin(a-b) \right],
\]
we can rewrite the displacement as:
\[
y = \frac{A}{2} \left[ \sin((90\pi + 6\pi)t) - \sin((90\pi - 6\pi)t) \right].
\]

Simplifying the arguments of the sine functions, we have:
\[
y = \frac{A}{2} \left[ \sin(96\pi t) - \sin(84\pi t) \right].
\]

The component frequencies are given by the angular frequencies divided by \(2\pi\):
\[
f_1 = \frac{96\pi}{2\pi} = 48 \text{ Hz}, \quad f_2 = \frac{84\pi}{2\pi} = 42 \text{ Hz}.
\]

The beat frequency is the absolute difference between the two component frequencies:
\[
f_{\text{beat}} = |f_1 - f_2| = |48 - 42| = 6 \text{ Hz}.
\]

Thus, the frequencies of the component vibrations are 48 Hz and 42 Hz, and the beat frequency is 6 Hz.

\[
\nu = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}
\]

where:
- \(\nu\) is the frequency,
- \(k\) is the force constant,
- \(\mu\) is the reduced mass of the molecule.

The reduced mass \(\mu\) is given by:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

where \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are the masses of the hydrogen (H) and chlorine (Cl) atoms, respectively. Given:

- \(m_1 = 1.0 \, \text{amu} = 1.0 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\),
- \(m_2 = 36.46 \, \text{amu} = 36.46 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\),
- \(k = 480 \, \text{N/m}\).

First, calculate the reduced mass \(\mu\):

\[
\mu = \frac{(1.0 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) \times (36.46 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg})}{(1.0 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) + (36.46 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg})}

Simplifying, we find:

\[
\mu = \frac{1.0 \times 36.46 \times (1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg})^2}{(1.0 + 36.46) \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}}
\]

\[
\mu = \frac{36.46 \times (1.66 \times 10^{-27})}{37.46} \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]

Now, substitute \(\mu\) and \(k\) into the frequency formula:

The resultant vibration \( y \) is the sum of the individual vibrations:

\[
y = y_1 + y_2 + y_3
\]

Substituting the given expressions, we have:

\[
y = \cos \omega t + \frac{1}{2} \cos\left(\omega t + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{3} \cos(\omega t + \pi)
\]

To simplify, we use the trigonometric identities for phase shifts:

\[
\cos\left(\omega t + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -\sin \omega t
\]
\[
\cos(\omega t + \pi) = -\cos \omega t
\]

Substituting these identities into the expression for \( y \), we get:

\[
y = \cos \omega t - \frac{1}{2} \sin \omega t - \frac{1}{3} \cos \omega t
\]

Combining the cosine terms:

\[
y = \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \cos \omega t - \frac{1}{2} \sin \omega t
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
y = \frac{2}{3} \cos \omega t - \frac{1}{2} \sin \omega t

\section*{Problem}

A mass attached to a spring vibrates with a natural frequency of 20 cycles per second (c/s) while its frequency for damped vibrations is 16 c/s. Determine the logarithmic decrement.

\section*{Solution}

The natural frequency of the system is given by:
\[
f_0 = 20 \, \text{c/s}
\]

The damped frequency of the system is:
\[
f_d = 16 \, \text{c/s}
\]

The relationship between the natural frequency, damped frequency, and the damping ratio (\(\zeta\)) is given by:
\[
f_d = f_0 \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(\zeta\), we have:
\[
\zeta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{f_d}{f_0}\right)^2}
\]

Substituting the given frequencies:
\[
\zeta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{16}{20}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{16}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{25}} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

The logarithmic decrement (\(\delta\)) is related to the damping ratio by:
\[
\delta = 2\pi \zeta
\]

Therefore, substituting the value of \(\zeta\):
\[
\delta = 2\pi \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{6\pi}{5}
\]

Thus, the logarithmic decrement is:
\[
\delta = \frac{6\pi}{5}

    \item \textbf{Underdamped:} The system is underdamped when the discriminant of the characteristic equation is negative. For the characteristic equation \( 4\lambda^2 + r\lambda + 32 = 0 \), the discriminant is given by:
    \[
    \Delta = r^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 32 = r^2 - 512

A periodic force acts on a 6 kg mass suspended from the lower end of a vertical spring with a spring constant of \( k = 150 \, \text{N/m} \). The damping force is proportional to the instantaneous speed of the mass and is 80 N when \( v = 2 \, \text{m/s} \). Find the resonance frequency.

\section*{Solution}

First, we identify the damping coefficient \( c \). The damping force \( F_d \) is given by:

\[
F_d = c \cdot v
\]

Given that \( F_d = 80 \, \text{N} \) when \( v = 2 \, \text{m/s} \), we can solve for \( c \):

\[
80 = c \cdot 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \, \text{Ns/m}
\]

The resonance frequency \( \omega_r \) for a damped harmonic oscillator is given by:

\[
\omega_r = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m} - \left(\frac{c}{2m}\right)^2}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\omega_r = \sqrt{\frac{150}{6} - \left(\frac{40}{2 \times 6}\right)^2}
\]

Calculate each term:

\[
\frac{150}{6} = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad \left(\frac{40}{12}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{10}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11
\]

Thus, the resonance frequency is:

\[
\omega_r = \sqrt{25 - 11.11} = \sqrt{13.89} \approx 3.72 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

Therefore, the resonance frequency is approximately \( 3.72 \, \text{rad/s} \).

m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + r \frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0
\]

where \( m \) is the mass, \( r \) is the resistance constant, and \( k \) is the spring constant. The solution to this differential equation is given by:

\[
x(t) = A e^{-\frac{r}{2m} t} \cos\left(\omega_d t + \phi\right)
\]

where \( \omega_d = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m} - \left(\frac{r}{2m}\right)^2} \) is the damped angular frequency, \( A \) is the amplitude, and \( \phi \) is the phase constant.

The maximum displacements occur when the cosine term is equal to \(\pm 1\), which happens at:

\[
\omega_d t + \phi = n\pi
\]

for \( n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \). The time elapsed between successive maximum displacements, \( \Delta t \), is given by:

\[
\omega_d (t_{n+1} - t_n) = (n+1)\pi - n\pi = \pi
\]

Thus, the time interval is:

\[
\Delta t = \frac{\pi}{\omega_d}
\]

Substituting the expression for \(\omega_d\), we have:

\[
\Delta t = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{k}{m} - \left(\frac{r}{2m}\right)^2}}
\]

Simplifying further, we use the substitution \( 2b = \frac{r}{m} \), so \( b = \frac{r}{2m} \). Then:

\[
\Delta t = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{k}{m} - b^2}}
\]

Rewriting in terms of \( r \), we have:

\[
\Delta t = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{k}{m} - \left(\frac{r}{2m}\right)^2}}
\]

Finally, the expression for the time elapsed between successive maximum displacements is:

\[
\Delta t = \frac{4\pi m}{\sqrt{4km - r^2}}
\]

Thus, the time elapsed between successive maximum displacements of a damped harmonic oscillator is constant and equal to \(\frac{4\pi m}{\sqrt{4km - r^2}}\)."

\section*{Problem}

A weight attached to a light spring extends it by 9.8 cm. It is then slightly pulled down and released. Assuming that the logarithmic decrement is equal to 3.1, find the period of oscillation.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we need to find the period of oscillation of a damped harmonic oscillator. The logarithmic decrement, \(\delta\), is given by:

\[
\delta = \ln \left( \frac{A_n}{A_{n+1}} \right)
\]

where \(A_n\) and \(A_{n+1}\) are the amplitudes of successive oscillations.

Given that the logarithmic decrement \(\delta = 3.1\), we can relate it to the damping ratio \(\zeta\) and the natural frequency \(\omega_0\) using the formula:

\[
\delta = \frac{2\pi \zeta}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}
\]

However, to find the period of oscillation \(T\), we use the formula for the period of a damped oscillator:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_d}
\]

where \(\omega_d\) is the damped angular frequency, given by:

\[
\omega_d = \omega_0 \sqrt{1-\zeta^2}
\]

The natural frequency \(\omega_0\) can be found using the spring constant \(k\) and mass \(m\):

\[
\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

Since the spring extends by 9.8 cm under the weight, we can find \(k\) using Hooke's law:

\[
mg = k \times 0.098
\]

Thus, the period of oscillation \(T\) can be calculated once \(\zeta\) and \(\omega_0\) are known. However, without additional information about the mass or spring constant, we cannot compute a numerical value for \(T\) directly from the given data.

6.66,"To show the relationship between the half-life \( t_{1/2} \) and the time constant \( \tau \), we start with the exponential decay formula for energy:

\[
E(t) = E_0 e^{-t/\tau}
\]

where \( E_0 \) is the initial energy, \( t \) is time, and \( \tau \) is the time constant.

The half-life \( t_{1/2} \) is defined as the time at which the energy decreases to half its initial value:

\[
E(t_{1/2}) = \frac{E_0}{2}
\]

Substituting into the decay formula, we have:

\[
\frac{E_0}{2} = E_0 e^{-t_{1/2}/\tau}
\]

Dividing both sides by \( E_0 \) gives:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = e^{-t_{1/2}/\tau}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{t_{1/2}}{\tau}
\]

Since \(\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\ln(2)\), we have:

\[
-\ln(2) = -\frac{t_{1/2}}{\tau}
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
t_{1/2} = \tau \ln(2)
\]

Thus, the half-life \( t_{1/2} \) is related to the time constant \( \tau \) by:

\[
t_{1/2} = \tau \ln 2

The equation for simple harmonic motion is given by:
\begin{equation}
    x = A \sin(\omega t)
\end{equation}

where \( \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} \).

Given that the amplitude drops by a factor of \( \frac{1}{e} \) in 8 periods, we can relate this to the quality factor \( Q \) using the formula:
\begin{equation}
    Q = \frac{\pi N}{\ln(\text{amplitude reduction factor})}
\end{equation}

Substituting \( N = 8 \) and the amplitude reduction factor as \( e \), we have:

    Q = \frac{\pi \times 8}{\ln(e)} = 8\pi

Solving for mass \( m \):
\begin{equation}
