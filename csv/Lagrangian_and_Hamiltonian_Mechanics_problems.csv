\section*{Problem Statement}

Consider a particle of mass $m$ moving in a plane under the attractive force $\frac{\mu m}{r^2}$ directed towards the origin in polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$. Determine the equations of motion.

\section*{Solution}

The force acting on the particle is given by:
\[
\mathbf{F} = -\frac{\mu m}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]
where $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector in the radial direction.

In polar coordinates, the position of the particle is described by $(r, \theta)$. The equations of motion can be derived from Newton's second law:
\[
m \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{F}
\]

The acceleration $\mathbf{a}$ in polar coordinates is given by:
\[
\mathbf{a} = \left( \ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 \right) \hat{\mathbf{r}} + \left( r \ddot{\theta} + 2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta} \right) \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}
\]

Substituting the expression for force and equating components, we have:

1. Radial component:
\[
m \left( \ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 \right) = -\frac{\mu m}{r^2}
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 = -\frac{\mu}{r^2}
\]

2. Angular component:
\[
m \left( r \ddot{\theta} + 2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta} \right) = 0
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
r \ddot{\theta} + 2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta} = 0
\]

These are the equations of motion for the particle in polar coordinates under the given force.

\section*{Lagrangian for a Simple Harmonic Oscillator}

The Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L} \) for a simple harmonic oscillator is given by the difference between the kinetic energy \( T \) and the potential energy \( V \). For a particle of mass \( m \) attached to a spring with spring constant \( k \), the kinetic and potential energies are:

\[
T = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2
\]

\[
V = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

Thus, the Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L} \) is:

\[
\mathcal{L} = T - V = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2 - \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

\section*{Expression for the Time Period}

To find the time period of the simple harmonic oscillator, we start with the equation of motion derived from the Euler-Lagrange equation:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{x}} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 0
\]

Substituting the Lagrangian:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} (m \dot{x}) + k x = 0
\]

This simplifies to the well-known differential equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator:

\[
m \ddot{x} + k x = 0
\]

The solution to this differential equation is:

\[
x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
\]

where \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) is the angular frequency. The time period \( T \) is related to the angular frequency by:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
\]

Thus, the time period of the simple harmonic oscillator is:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}

\section*{Problem Statement}

A particle of mass $m$ slides on a smooth incline at an angle $\alpha$. The incline is not permitted to move. Determine the acceleration of the block.

\section*{Solution}

To find the acceleration of the block, we start by analyzing the forces acting on it. The gravitational force acting on the block is $mg$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. This force can be decomposed into two components: one perpendicular to the incline and one parallel to the incline.

The component of the gravitational force parallel to the incline is given by:
\[
F_{\parallel} = mg \sin \alpha
\]

Since the incline is smooth, there is no friction, and the only force causing the block to accelerate down the incline is $F_{\parallel}$. According to Newton's second law, the acceleration $a$ of the block is given by:
\[
F_{\parallel} = ma
\]

Substituting the expression for $F_{\parallel}$, we have:
\[
mg \sin \alpha = ma
\]

Solving for the acceleration $a$, we get:
\[
a = g \sin \alpha
\]

Thus, the acceleration of the block is $g \sin \alpha$.

\section*{Problem Statement}

A bead of mass $m$ is free to slide on a smooth straight wire of negligible mass, which is constrained to rotate in a vertical plane with constant angular speed $\omega$ about a fixed point. Determine the equation of motion and find the distance $x$ from the fixed point at time $t$. Assume that at $t = 0$ the wire is horizontal.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we start by considering the forces acting on the bead. Since the wire rotates with a constant angular speed $\omega$, the bead experiences a centripetal force. The position of the bead can be described in polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$, where $r$ is the distance from the fixed point and $\theta = \omega t$ is the angular position.

The radial component of the acceleration is given by:
\[
a_r = \ddot{r} - r \omega^2
\]

Since the bead is constrained to move along the wire, the radial acceleration $a_r$ must be zero. Therefore, we have:
\[
\ddot{r} = r \omega^2
\]

This is the equation of motion for the bead. To find the distance $x$ from the fixed point at time $t$, we solve this differential equation. Assuming the initial conditions $r(0) = r_0$ and $\dot{r}(0) = 0$, the solution is given by:
\[
r(t) = r_0 \cosh(\omega t)
\]

Thus, the distance $x$ from the fixed point at time $t$ is:
\[
x(t) = r_0 \cosh(\omega t)
\]

This completes the solution to the problem.

\section*{One-Dimensional Harmonic Oscillator}

The Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is given by:

\begin{equation}
H = \frac{1}{2} p^2 + \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 q^2
\end{equation}

where \( p \) is the momentum, \( q \) is the position, and \( \omega \) is the angular frequency.

\subsection*{Hamilton's Equations}

Hamilton's equations are given by:

\begin{align}
\dot{q} &= \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} = p \\
\dot{p} &= -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q} = -\omega^2 q
\end{align}

\subsection*{General Solution}

To find the general solution, we solve the system of differential equations. From the second equation, we have:

\[
\dot{p} = -\omega^2 q \implies \ddot{q} = -\omega^2 q
\]

This is a second-order differential equation with the general solution:

\begin{equation}
q(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
\end{equation}

where \( A \) is the amplitude and \( \phi \) is the phase constant.

The corresponding momentum \( p(t) \) can be found using:

\begin{equation}
p(t) = \dot{q}(t) = -A \omega \sin(\omega t + \phi)
\end{equation}

Thus, the general solution for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is given by the position and momentum as functions of time.

7.15,"To determine the equations for planetary motion using Hamilton's equations, we start by considering the Hamiltonian for a two-body problem in a central force field, such as the gravitational interaction between a planet and a star. The Hamiltonian \( H \) for such a system is given by:

\[
H = \frac{\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} - \frac{G M m}{r}
\]

where:
- \( \mathbf{p} \) is the momentum vector of the planet,
- \( m \) is the mass of the planet,
- \( M \) is the mass of the star,
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( r \) is the radial distance between the planet and the star.

Hamilton's equations are given by:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{q}} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}}
\]
\[
\dot{\mathbf{p}} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{q}}
\]

where \( \mathbf{q} \) represents the generalized coordinates, and \( \mathbf{p} \) represents the generalized momenta.

For our Hamiltonian, the equations become:

1. **Equation for \(\dot{\mathbf{q}}\):**

\[
\dot{\mathbf{q}} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \left( \frac{\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} \right) = \frac{\mathbf{p}}{m}
\]

2. **Equation for \(\dot{\mathbf{p}}\):**

\[
\dot{\mathbf{p}} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \left( -\frac{G M m}{r} \right) = -\nabla \left( -\frac{G M m}{r} \right) = -\frac{G M m}{r^3} \mathbf{r}
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{q} \) is the position vector.

Thus, the equations of motion for a planet in a gravitational field using Hamilton's equations are:

\[
\dot{\mathbf{q}} = \frac{\mathbf{p}}{m}
\]
\[
\dot{\mathbf{p}} = -\frac{G M m}{r^3} \mathbf{r}

These equations describe the time evolution of the position and momentum of the planet in the gravitational field of the star."

\section*{Problem Statement}

Determine the equations of motion of an insect of mass \( m \) crawling at a uniform speed \( v \) on a uniform heavy rod of mass \( M \) and length \( 2a \), which is turning about a fixed end. Assume that at \( t = 0 \) the insect is at the midpoint of the rod and it is crawling downwards.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we need to consider the dynamics of the system, which consists of the rod and the insect. The rod is rotating about a fixed end, and the insect is moving along the rod. The position of the insect as a function of time can be given by:

\[
x(t) = a + vt
\]

where \( x(t) \) is the position of the insect along the rod, \( a \) is the initial position of the insect (midpoint of the rod), and \( v \) is the speed of the insect.

The moment of inertia \( I \) of the rod about the fixed end is:

\[
I = \frac{1}{3} M (2a)^2 = \frac{4}{3} M a^2
\]

The angular momentum \( L \) of the system is the sum of the angular momentum of the rod and the insect. The angular momentum of the rod is:

\[
L_{\text{rod}} = I \omega
\]

where \( \omega \) is the angular velocity of the rod.

The angular momentum of the insect is:

\[
L_{\text{insect}} = m x(t)^2 \omega
\]

Thus, the total angular momentum \( L \) is:

\[
L = L_{\text{rod}} + L_{\text{insect}} = \left( \frac{4}{3} M a^2 + m x(t)^2 \right) \omega
\]

Assuming no external torques, the angular momentum is conserved:

\[
\frac{dL}{dt} = 0
\]

Differentiating \( L \) with respect to time and setting it to zero gives:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \left( \frac{4}{3} M a^2 + m x(t)^2 \right) \omega \right) = 0
\]

Solving this differential equation will provide the equations of motion for the system.

\section*{Problem}

A uniform rod of mass $M$ and length $2a$ is attached at one end by a cord of length $l$ to a fixed point. Calculate the inclination of the string and the rod when the string plus rod system revolves about the vertical through the pivot with constant angular velocity $\omega$.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we need to consider the forces acting on the system and the resulting equilibrium conditions. 

Let $\theta$ be the angle between the rod and the vertical, and $\phi$ be the angle between the string and the vertical. The system is in rotational equilibrium, so we apply the following principles:

1. **Centripetal Force:** The tension $T$ in the cord provides the necessary centripetal force for the rotation of the system. The centripetal force is given by:
   \[
   T \sin \phi = M_{\text{eff}} \omega^2 r
   \]
   where $M_{\text{eff}}$ is the effective mass of the system and $r$ is the distance from the pivot to the center of mass of the system.

2. **Vertical Force Balance:** The vertical components of the tension and the weight of the rod must balance:
   \[
   T \cos \phi = M g
   \]

3. **Geometry of the System:** The geometry of the system gives us:
   \[
   r = l \sin \phi + a \sin \theta
   \]

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$. However, the detailed solution requires further analysis and simplification of these equations, which can be complex depending on the specific values of $M$, $a$, $l$, and $\omega$.

\section*{Problem}

In problem (7.12) on the double pendulum, if $m_1 = m_2 = m$ and $l_1 = l_2 = l$, obtain the frequencies of oscillation.

\section*{Solution}

For a double pendulum with equal masses and lengths, the equations of motion can be derived using the Lagrangian or Newtonian mechanics. The system can be linearized for small oscillations, leading to a set of coupled differential equations. Solving these equations, we find the normal mode frequencies.

The characteristic equation for the system is given by:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\omega^2 - \frac{g}{l} & -\frac{g}{l} \\
-\frac{g}{l} & \omega^2 - \frac{g}{l}
\end{vmatrix} = 0
\]

Solving the determinant, we have:

\[
(\omega^2 - \frac{g}{l})^2 - \left(\frac{g}{l}\right)^2 = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(\omega^2 - \frac{g}{l} + \frac{g}{l})(\omega^2 - \frac{g}{l} - \frac{g}{l}) = 0
\]

\[
(\omega^2)(\omega^2 - 2\frac{g}{l}) = 0
\]

Thus, the solutions for $\omega^2$ are:

\[
\omega_1^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \omega_2^2 = 2\frac{g}{l}
\]

Therefore, the frequencies of oscillation are:

\[
\omega_1 = 0 \quad \text{(trivial solution, corresponding to no motion)}
\]

\[
\omega_2 = \sqrt{2\frac{g}{l}}
\]

The non-trivial frequency of oscillation for the double pendulum is $\omega_2 = \sqrt{2\frac{g}{l}}$.

\section*{Problem}

A bead of mass $m$ slides freely on a smooth circular wire of radius $r$ which rotates with constant angular velocity $\omega$. On a horizontal plane about a point fixed on its circumference, show that the bead performs simple harmonic motion about the diameter passing through the fixed point as a pendulum of length $r = \frac{g}{\omega^2}$.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we consider the forces acting on the bead. The bead is subject to the centripetal force due to the rotation of the wire and the gravitational force. 

The centripetal force required to keep the bead moving in a circle of radius $r$ is given by:
\[
F_c = m \omega^2 r
\]

The gravitational force acting on the bead is:
\[
F_g = mg
\]

For the bead to perform simple harmonic motion (SHM), the net force acting on it must be proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position. In this case, the equilibrium position is at the lowest point of the circular path.

The equation of motion for SHM is:
\[
m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -kx
\]

where $k$ is the effective spring constant. For a pendulum of length $L$, the angular frequency $\omega_0$ is given by:
\[
\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}
\]

In this scenario, the effective length $L$ of the pendulum is such that:
\[
L = \frac{g}{\omega^2}
\]

Thus, the bead performs simple harmonic motion with the angular frequency:
\[
\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{r}}
\]

Therefore, the bead behaves like a pendulum with an effective length $r = \frac{g}{\omega^2}$.

\section*{Problem Statement}

A uniform spherical ball of mass $m$ rolls without slipping down a wedge of mass $M$ and angle $\alpha$, which itself can slide without friction on a horizontal table. The system moves in the plane shown in Fig. 7.12. Here $g$ denotes the gravitational acceleration. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Find the Lagrangian and the equations of motion for this system.
    \item[(b)] For the special case of $M = m$ and $\alpha = \pi/4$, find:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(i)] the acceleration of the wedge,
        \item[(ii)] the acceleration of the ball relative to the wedge.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Useful information:} Moment of inertia of a uniform sphere of mass $m$ and radius $R$ is $I = \frac{2}{5}mR^2$.

\section*{Solution}

This is obviously a two degree of freedom dynamical system. The square of the particle velocity can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    v^2 = \dot{r}^2 + (r\dot{\theta})^2
\end{equation}

Formula (1) can be derived from Cartesian coordinates:

\begin{align*}
    x &= r \cos \theta, \\
    y &= r \sin \theta, \\
    \dot{x} &= \dot{r} \cos \theta - r \dot{\theta} \sin \theta, \\
    \dot{y} &= \dot{r} \sin \theta + r \dot{\theta} \cos \theta.
\end{align*}
