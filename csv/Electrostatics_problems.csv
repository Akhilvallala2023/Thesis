As a spark is produced between two insulated surfaces, maintained at a constant potential difference of \(5 \times 10^6 \, \text{V}\), if the energy output is \(10^{-5} \, \text{J}\), calculate the charge transferred. How many electrons have flowed? \textit{[Indian Institute of Technology 1974]}

\section*{Solution}

The energy \(E\) transferred in an electric field is given by the equation:
\[
E = V \cdot Q
\]
where \(E\) is the energy, \(V\) is the potential difference, and \(Q\) is the charge transferred.

Given:
\[
E = 10^{-5} \, \text{J}, \quad V = 5 \times 10^6 \, \text{V}
\]

We can solve for \(Q\) as follows:
\[
Q = \frac{E}{V} = \frac{10^{-5} \, \text{J}}{5 \times 10^6 \, \text{V}} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}
\]

Next, to find the number of electrons \(n\) that have flowed, we use the charge of a single electron \(e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\):
\[
n = \frac{Q}{e} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C/electron}} \approx 1.25 \times 10^7 \, \text{electrons}
\]

Thus, the charge transferred is \(2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}\) and approximately \(1.25 \times 10^7\) electrons have flowed.

\begin{document}

\section*{Millikan's Oil Drop Method}

The electronic charge \( e \) can be determined using Millikan's oil drop method. Consider an oil drop of radius \( r \) that acquires a terminal speed \( v_1 \) with a downward electric field \( E \) and a speed \( v_2 \) with an upward electric field. We aim to derive an expression for \( e \) in terms of \( E \), \( v_1 \), \( v_2 \), \( r \), and the viscosity of oil in air, \( \eta \).

\subsection*{Derivation}

When the oil drop reaches terminal velocity, the forces acting on it are balanced. For the downward motion with speed \( v_1 \), the forces are:

\[
F_{\text{gravity}} + F_{\text{electric}} = F_{\text{drag}}
\]

\[
mg + eE = 6\pi \eta r v_1
\]

For the upward motion with speed \( v_2 \), the forces are:

\[
F_{\text{gravity}} = F_{\text{electric}} + F_{\text{drag}}
\]

\[
mg = eE + 6\pi \eta r v_2
\]

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we can eliminate \( mg \) (the gravitational force) and solve for \( e \):

1. From the first equation:
   \[
   mg = 6\pi \eta r v_1 - eE
   \]

2. Substitute \( mg \) from the first equation into the second equation:
   \[
   6\pi \eta r v_1 - eE = eE + 6\pi \eta r v_2
   \]

3. Rearrange to solve for \( e \):
   \[
   6\pi \eta r v_1 - 6\pi \eta r v_2 = 2eE
   \]

4. Simplify:
   \[
   e = \frac{3\pi \eta r (v_1 - v_2)}{E}
   \]

Thus, the expression for the electronic charge \( e \) in terms of the given variables is:

\[
e = \frac{3\pi \eta r (v_1 - v_2)}{E}
\]

\section*{Problem}

A circular wire of radius $r$ has a uniform linear charge density $\lambda = \lambda_0 \cos^2 \theta$. Show that the total charge on the wire is $\pi \lambda_0 r$.

\section*{Solution}

To find the total charge $Q$ on the wire, we integrate the linear charge density $\lambda$ over the entire circumference of the circle. The linear charge density is given by:

\[
\lambda(\theta) = \lambda_0 \cos^2 \theta
\]

The differential charge element $dq$ on an infinitesimal segment of the wire is:

\[
dq = \lambda(\theta) \, rd\theta = \lambda_0 \cos^2 \theta \, rd\theta
\]

The total charge $Q$ is obtained by integrating $dq$ over the full circle from $\theta = 0$ to $\theta = 2\pi$:

\[
Q = \int_0^{2\pi} \lambda_0 \cos^2 \theta \, r \, d\theta
\]

Using the trigonometric identity $\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2}$, we can rewrite the integral as:

\[
Q = \lambda_0 r \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2} \, d\theta
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
Q = \frac{\lambda_0 r}{2} \left( \int_0^{2\pi} 1 \, d\theta + \int_0^{2\pi} \cos(2\theta) \, d\theta \right)
\]

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} 1 \, d\theta = 2\pi
\]

The second integral evaluates to zero because the integral of $\cos(2\theta)$ over a full period is zero:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \cos(2\theta) \, d\theta = 0
\]

Thus, the total charge $Q$ is:

\[
Q = \frac{\lambda_0 r}{2} \times 2\pi = \pi \lambda_0 r
\]

Therefore, the total charge on the wire is $\pi \lambda_0 r$.

\section*{Problem Statement}

Charges are placed at the four corners of a square of side $a$, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Find the magnitude and direction of the electric field at the center of the square.

    \caption{Charges at the corners of a square}
    \label{fig:11_3}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

To find the electric field at the center of the square, we consider the contributions from each charge. Let the charges be $q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4$ located at the corners of the square. The distance from each charge to the center of the square is $\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}$.

The electric field due to a point charge $q$ at a distance $r$ is given by:
\[
\mathbf{E} = \frac{k \cdot q}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]
where $k = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}$ is Coulomb's constant and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the point of interest.

Since the square is symmetric, the horizontal and vertical components of the electric fields due to opposite charges will cancel each other out if the charges are equal and opposite. Therefore, we need to calculate the resultant electric field vector at the center.

Assuming all charges are equal, the net electric field $\mathbf{E}_{\text{net}}$ at the center is:
\[
\mathbf{E}_{\text{net}} = 4 \cdot \frac{k \cdot q}{\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
\mathbf{E}_{\text{net}} = \frac{4kq}{a^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]

The direction of the electric field will depend on the configuration of the charges. If all charges are the same, the electric field will point outward from the center. If opposite charges are equal, the field will point towards the positive charge.

\section*{Problem Statement}

An arc in the $xy$-plane is given a total charge $Q = 2\pi R \lambda$. Show that the electric field $E$ is maximum when the distance $z = \frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}$.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we first need to express the electric field $E$ due to the arc at a point along the $z$-axis. The arc is part of a circle of radius $R$ with a linear charge density $\lambda$. The total charge on the arc is given by:

\[
Q = 2\pi R \lambda
\]

The electric field at a point on the $z$-axis due to a small charge element $dq$ on the arc is given by:

\[
dE = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{dq}{r^2}
\]

where $r$ is the distance from the charge element to the point on the $z$-axis. Since the arc is symmetric about the $z$-axis, we only need to consider the $z$-component of the electric field. The $z$-component is:

\[
dE_z = dE \cos \theta = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{dq}{r^2} \cos \theta
\]

where $\cos \theta = \frac{z}{r}$ and $r = \sqrt{R^2 + z^2}$.

The total electric field $E_z$ is obtained by integrating over the entire arc:

\[
E_z = \int dE_z = \int \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{\lambda R d\theta}{(R^2 + z^2)} \frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}}
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
E_z = \frac{\lambda z}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \int \frac{R d\theta}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}
\]

Evaluating the integral over the arc from $-\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$, we find:

\[
E_z = \frac{\lambda z R}{2\varepsilon_0 (R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}
\]

To find the maximum value of $E_z$, we differentiate with respect to $z$ and set the derivative to zero:

\[
\frac{dE_z}{dz} = 0
\]

Solving this equation, we find:

\[
z = \frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Thus, the electric field $E$ is maximum when the distance $z = \frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}$.

\section*{Electric Field of a Quadrupole}

Consider a quadrupole consisting of four charges: \( q, q, -q, -q \), located at the corners of a square with side length \( a \) (as shown in Fig. 11.4). We want to show that at a point \( P \), at a distance \( r \) from the center of the charges and in the same plane, the electric field varies inversely as the fourth power of \( r \), where \( r \gg a \).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    %\includegraphics{figure11_4.png} % Uncomment this line and provide the correct path to the figure file
    \caption{Configuration of the quadrupole charges.}
    \label{fig:quadrupole}
\end{figure}

To analyze the electric field at point \( P \), we consider the contributions from each of the four charges. The potential \( V \) at a distance \( r \) from the center due to a single charge \( q \) is given by:

\[
V = \frac{kq}{r}
\]

where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant. For a quadrupole, the potential at a point far from the charge configuration (\( r \gg a \)) can be expanded in a multipole series. The leading term for a quadrupole is:

\[
V_{\text{quad}} = \frac{kQ}{r^3}
\]

where \( Q \) is the quadrupole moment. The electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) is related to the potential by:

\[
\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V
\]

For the quadrupole, the electric field at point \( P \) is:

\[
E_{\text{quad}} = \frac{3kQ}{r^4}
\]

Thus, the electric field varies inversely as the fourth power of \( r \), confirming that:

\[
E \propto \frac{1}{r^4}
\]

This result holds under the condition \( r \gg a \), where the higher-order terms in the multipole expansion become negligible.

11.29,"To show that the electrical and gravitational forces between two bodies are equal at any distance \( r \) when the ratio \( \frac{q}{m} = 8.6 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{C/kg} \), we start by equating the magnitudes of the gravitational and electrical forces.

The gravitational force \( F_g \) between two masses \( m \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:

\[
F_g = \frac{G m^2}{r^2}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant.

The electrical force \( F_e \) between two charges \( q \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:

\[
F_e = \frac{k q^2}{r^2}
\]

where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant.

For the forces to be equal, we set \( F_g = F_e \):

\[
\frac{G m^2}{r^2} = \frac{k q^2}{r^2}
\]

Canceling \( \frac{1}{r^2} \) from both sides, we get:

\[
G m^2 = k q^2
\]

Rearranging for the ratio \( \frac{q}{m} \), we have:

\[
\frac{q^2}{m^2} = \frac{G}{k}
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
\frac{q}{m} = \sqrt{\frac{G}{k}}
\]

Given \( \frac{q}{m} = 8.6 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{C/kg} \), we need to verify this value with known constants:

- Gravitational constant: \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \)
- Coulomb's constant: \( k = 8.9875 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2 \, \text{C}^{-2} \)

Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{q}{m} = \sqrt{\frac{6.674 \times 10^{-11}}{8.9875 \times 10^9}}
\]

Calculating the above expression:

\[
\frac{q}{m} \approx 8.6 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{C/kg}
\]

Thus, the ratio \( \frac{q}{m} = 8.6 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{C/kg} \) satisfies the condition for the electrical and gravitational forces to be equal at any distance \( r \)."

\title{Physics Problem: Interaction Energy of Charges}
\author{}

\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

Three charges \( +q \), \( +q \), and \( Q \) are located at the vertices of a right-angled isosceles triangle, as shown in Fig. 11.6. If the total interaction energy is zero, what should be the value of \( Q \)?

    \caption{Charges at the vertices of a right-angled isosceles triangle.}
    \label{fig:triangle}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

The interaction energy \( U \) of the system of charges can be expressed as the sum of the pairwise potential energies:

\begin{equation}
U = k_e \left( \frac{q \cdot q}{r} + \frac{q \cdot Q}{r} + \frac{q \cdot Q}{r} \right),
\end{equation}

where \( k_e \) is Coulomb's constant and \( r \) is the distance between the charges \( +q \) and \( Q \).

Given that the total interaction energy is zero, we have:

\begin{equation}
k_e \left( \frac{q^2}{r} + \frac{2qQ}{r} \right) = 0.
\end{equation}

Simplifying, we find:

\begin{equation}
q^2 + 2qQ = 0.
\end{equation}

Solving for \( Q \), we get:

\begin{equation}
Q = -\frac{q}{2}.
\end{equation}

Thus, the value of \( Q \) should be \( -\frac{q}{2} \) for the total interaction energy to be zero.

\section*{Problem}

Four charges, each of magnitude $q$, are located at the four corners of a square of side $a$ such that like charges occupy the corners across the diagonals (see Fig. 11.7). Calculate the work done in assembling these charges.

\section*{Solution}

To calculate the work done in assembling the charges, we consider the potential energy of the system of charges. The potential energy $U$ of a system of point charges is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \sum_{i < j} \frac{q_i q_j}{r_{ij}}
\]

In this problem, we have four charges, each of magnitude $q$. Let's denote the charges as $q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4$. The charges are placed at the corners of a square with side length $a$. The distance between any two adjacent charges is $a$, and the distance between any two charges across the diagonal is $\sqrt{2}a$.

The potential energy of the system can be calculated as follows:

1. Potential energy between adjacent charges:
   \[
   U_{\text{adjacent}} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q^2}{a}
   \]

2. Potential energy between charges across the diagonal:
   \[
   U_{\text{diagonal}} = 2 \times \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q^2}{\sqrt{2}a}
   \]

The total potential energy of the system is the sum of these contributions:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{adjacent}} + U_{\text{diagonal}} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q^2}{a} + 2 \times \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q^2}{\sqrt{2}a}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = \frac{q^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 a} \left( 4 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{q^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 a} \left( 4 + \sqrt{2} \right)
\]

Thus, the work done in assembling the charges is:

\[
W = U_{\text{total}} = \frac{q^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 a} \left( 4 + \sqrt{2} \right)
\]

\section*{Potential Energy of a Charged Sphere}

To calculate the total potential energy \( U \) of a sphere of radius \( R \) carrying a uniformly distributed charge \( q \), we consider the sphere as being built up by bringing infinitesimal charges \( dq \) from infinity to the sphere.

The potential energy \( U \) can be expressed as:
\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \int \phi \, dq
\]
where \( \phi \) is the electric potential at the surface of the sphere due to the charge already present.

For a uniformly charged sphere, the potential \( \phi \) at the surface is given by:
\[
\phi = \frac{k_e q}{R}
\]
where \( k_e \) is Coulomb's constant, \( k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \).

The total potential energy \( U \) is then:
\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^q \frac{k_e q'}{R} \, dq' = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k_e}{R} \int_0^q q' \, dq'
\]

Evaluating the integral:
\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k_e}{R} \left[ \frac{(q')^2}{2} \right]_0^q = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k_e}{R} \cdot \frac{q^2}{2}
\]

Thus, the total potential energy of the sphere is:
\[
U = \frac{k_e q^2}{4R}
\]

This expression gives the self-energy of a uniformly charged sphere.

Figure 11.8 shows the linear quadrupole. Show that the electric potential $V(r)$ at a distance $r \gg d$ from the central charge and in a direction normal to the axis of the quadrupole varies inversely as the third power of $r$.

\section*{Solution}

The electric potential $V(r)$ due to a linear quadrupole at a point $P$ located at a distance $r$ from the central charge and in a direction normal to the axis of the quadrupole can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \left( \frac{qd}{r^3} \right)
\end{equation}

where $q$ is the magnitude of the charge, $d$ is the separation between the charges, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

For $r \gg d$, the potential $V(r)$ simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
V(r) \approx \frac{K}{r^3}

where $K$ is a constant that depends on the specific configuration of the quadrupole.

Thus, the electric potential $V(r)$ varies inversely as the third power of $r$, confirming the given statement.

11.46,"To show that the orbital motion of the electron in Bohr's hydrogen atom model obeys Kepler's third law of motion, which states that \( T^2 \propto r^3 \), we start by considering the relevant equations from Bohr's model and classical mechanics.

In Bohr's model, the centripetal force required to keep the electron in a circular orbit is provided by the electrostatic force between the electron and the proton. This can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{k e^2}{r^2}
\]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the electron,
- \( v \) is the orbital speed of the electron,
- \( r \) is the radius of the orbit,
- \( k \) is Coulomb's constant,
- \( e \) is the elementary charge.

From this equation, we can solve for the velocity \( v \):

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{mr}}
\]

The orbital period \( T \) is the time it takes for the electron to complete one full orbit, which is given by:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}
\]

Substituting the expression for \( v \) into the equation for \( T \), we get:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi r}{\sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{mr}}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{mr^3}{k e^2}}
\]

Squaring both sides of the equation to find \( T^2 \), we have:

\[
T^2 = (2\pi)^2 \frac{mr^3}{k e^2}
\]

This equation shows that:

\[
T^2 \propto r^3
\]

Thus, we have demonstrated that the orbital motion of the electron in Bohr's hydrogen atom model obeys Kepler's third law of motion."

F = \frac{1.914 Q^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 a^2}

To derive this, consider one of the charges at a corner of the square. The force on this charge is the vector sum of the forces due to the other three charges. Using Coulomb's law, the force between two point charges is given by:

\begin{equation}
F = \frac{k_e Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}
\end{equation}

where \( k_e = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \) is Coulomb's constant, and \( r \) is the distance between the charges.

For the charge at one corner, the distances to the other charges are:
- \( a \) for the two adjacent charges,
- \( \sqrt{2}a \) for the diagonally opposite charge.

The forces due to the adjacent charges are along the sides of the square, and the force due to the diagonal charge is along the diagonal. Calculating these forces and summing them vectorially gives the result as shown.

\section*{Problem}

In problem (11.50), the central part of the sphere is hollowed by creating a cavity of radius $R/2$ concentric with the original sphere. If the charge density of the hollowed sphere remains unchanged, show that the electric field at the surface is now $\frac{7}{8}$ of the original value on the surface.

\section*{Solution}

Let the original sphere have a radius $R$ and a uniform charge density $\rho$. The total charge $Q$ of the original sphere is given by:

\[
Q = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3
\]

When a cavity of radius $R/2$ is created, the charge removed from the cavity is:

\[
Q_{\text{cavity}} = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi \left(\frac{R}{2}\right)^3 = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{R^3}{8} = \frac{Q}{8}
\]

Thus, the charge of the hollowed sphere is:

\[
Q_{\text{hollowed}} = Q - Q_{\text{cavity}} = Q - \frac{Q}{8} = \frac{7Q}{8}
\]

The electric field at the surface of the original sphere (radius $R$) is given by Gauss's law:

\[
E_{\text{original}} = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 R^2}
\]

For the hollowed sphere, the electric field at the surface (still at radius $R$) becomes:

\[
E_{\text{hollowed}} = \frac{Q_{\text{hollowed}}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 R^2} = \frac{\frac{7Q}{8}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 R^2} = \frac{7}{8} \cdot \frac{Q}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 R^2} = \frac{7}{8} E_{\text{original}}
\]

Therefore, the electric field at the surface of the hollowed sphere is $\frac{7}{8}$ of the original value.

This LaTeX code includes a clear problem statement and a step-by-step solution using equations formatted with the `amsmath` package.

\subsection*{(a) Net Charge within a Spherical Shell}

The electric field on the surface of a thin spherical shell of radius \( R = \SI{0.5}{m} \) is measured to be \( E = \SI{800}{N/C} \) and points radially towards the center of the sphere. We are asked to find the net charge \( Q \) within the sphere's surface.

Using Gauss's Law, the electric field \( E \) is related to the charge \( Q \) by:
\[
E = \frac{kQ}{R^2}
\]
where \( k = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \) is Coulomb's constant. Solving for \( Q \), we have:
\[
Q = \frac{ER^2}{k}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
Q = \frac{(\SI{800}{N/C})(\SI{0.5}{m})^2}{\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}}
\]

Using \( \varepsilon_0 = \SI{8.85e-12}{C^2/N \cdot m^2} \), we find:
\[
Q = \frac{(\SI{800}{N/C})(\SI{0.25}{m^2})}{\frac{1}{4\pi \times \SI{8.85e-12}{C^2/N \cdot m^2}}}
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
Q \approx \SI{-4.42e-9}{C}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Surface Charge Density on a Football Field}

An electric field of \( E = \SI{120}{N/C} \) points down over a football field. We need to calculate the surface charge density \( \sigma \).

The surface charge density is given by:
\[
\sigma = \varepsilon_0 E
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
\sigma = (\SI{8.85e-12}{C^2/N \cdot m^2})(\SI{120}{N/C})
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
\sigma \approx \SI{1.062e-9}{C/m^2}
\]

\subsection*{(c) Total Electric Flux}

The electric field is uniform over an area \( A = \SI{100}{m} \times \SI{75}{m} \). We need to find the total electric flux \( \Phi_E \).

The electric flux is given by:
\[
\Phi_E = E \cdot A
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
\Phi_E = (\SI{120}{N/C})(\SI{100}{m} \times \SI{75}{m})

    \item[(b)] Two isolated conducting spheres, both of radius $a$, initially carry charges of $q_1$ and $q_2$ and are held far apart. The spheres are connected together by a conducting wire until equilibrium is reached, whereupon the wire is removed. Show that the total electrostatic energy stored in the spheres decreases by an amount $\Delta U$, given by $\Delta U = \frac{1}{16 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{(q_1 - q_2)^2}{Q}$. What happens to this energy?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] The capacitance $C$ of a conducting sphere of radius $a$ can be derived from the definition of capacitance:
    \[
    C = \frac{Q}{V}
    \]
    where $Q$ is the charge and $V$ is the potential. For a sphere, the potential $V$ at the surface is given by:
    \[
    V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{Q}{a}
    \]
    Substituting $V$ into the capacitance formula, we get:
    \[
    C = \frac{Q}{\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{Q}{a}} = 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 a
    \]
    Thus, the capacitance of a conducting sphere of radius $a$ is $C = 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 a$.

    \item[(b)] Initially, the total electrostatic energy stored in the two spheres is:
    \[
    U_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left( \frac{q_1^2}{a} + \frac{q_2^2}{a} \right)
    \]
    After connecting the spheres with a wire, charge redistributes until the potential on both spheres is equal. The final charge on each sphere is $Q = \frac{q_1 + q_2}{2}$.

    The total electrostatic energy after equilibrium is:
    \[
    U_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left( \frac{Q^2}{a} + \frac{Q^2}{a} \right) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{Q^2}{a}
    \]

    The change in energy is:
    \[
    \Delta U = U_{\text{final}} - U_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{Q^2}{a} - \frac{1}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left( \frac{q_1^2}{a} + \frac{q_2^2}{a} \right)
    \]

    Simplifying, we find:
    \[
    \Delta U = \frac{1}{16 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{(q_1 - q_2)^2}{a}
    \]

    The energy $\Delta U$ is dissipated as heat in the connecting wire during the charge redistribution process.

An insulating spherical shell of inner radius $r_1$ and outer radius $r_2$ is charged so that its volume charge density is given by:

0, & 0 \leq r < r_1 \\

\end{cases}
\]

where $A$ is a constant and $r$ is the radial distance from the center of the shell. Find the electric field due to the shell throughout all space.

\section*{Solution}

To find the electric field, we apply Gauss's law:

\[
\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}
\]

where $Q_{\text{enc}}$ is the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface.

\subsection*{Region 1: $0 \leq r < r_1$}

In this region, the charge density $\rho(r) = 0$, so $Q_{\text{enc}} = 0$. Thus, the electric field $\mathbf{E} = 0$.

\subsection*{Region 2: $r_1 \leq r \leq r_2$}

In this region, the charge density is $\rho(r) = A r$. The charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface of radius $r$ is:

\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = \int_{r_1}^{r} \rho(r') \cdot 4\pi r'^2 \, dr' = \int_{r_1}^{r} A r' \cdot 4\pi r'^2 \, dr'

\]

Applying Gauss's law:

\[
E \cdot 4\pi r^2 = \frac{\pi A (r^4 - r_1^4)}{\varepsilon_0}

E = \frac{A (r^4 - r_1^4)}{4 \varepsilon_0 r^2}

\[

\[

\section*{Problem}

Consider an isolated non-conducting sheet with charge density $\sigma$. The electric field at 25 cm from the sheet is found to be 200 V/m, directed towards the sheet. Calculate $\sigma$ on the sheet. What electric field is expected at 2 cm from its surface? How are the values of $\sigma$ and $E$ changed if a conducting sheet is substituted?

\section*{Solution}

For an infinite non-conducting sheet with surface charge density $\sigma$, the electric field $E$ at a distance from the sheet is given by:

\[
E = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}
\]

Given that the electric field $E = 200 \, \text{V/m}$ at a distance of 25 cm from the sheet, we can calculate $\sigma$ as follows:

\[
\sigma = 2\varepsilon_0 E
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\sigma = 2 \times (8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/\text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2) \times 200 \, \text{V/m} = 3.54 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C/m}^2
\]

Next, we calculate the electric field at 2 cm from the surface of the non-conducting sheet. Since the electric field due to an infinite sheet is uniform and does not depend on the distance from the sheet, the electric field remains:

\[
E = 200 \, \text{V/m}
\]

If a conducting sheet is substituted, the electric field outside the conducting sheet is zero because the charges redistribute themselves on the surface to cancel any internal electric field. Therefore, the electric field $E$ outside the conducting sheet is:

\[
E = 0 \, \text{V/m}
\]

The surface charge density $\sigma$ on a conducting sheet would still be the same as calculated above, but the field outside the conductor would be zero.

\section*{Problem}

Calculate the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor with area $A$ and thickness $d$ if a dielectric slab of thickness $t$, area $A$, and dielectric constant $k$ is inserted. How is the capacitance modified if a metal of thickness $t$ is introduced?

\section*{Solution}

The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor without any dielectric is given by:
\[
C_0 = \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{d}
\]
where $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

When a dielectric slab of thickness $t$ and dielectric constant $k$ is inserted, the capacitor can be considered as two capacitors in series: one with the dielectric and one with air. The effective capacitance $C$ is given by:
\[
\frac{1}{C} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}
\]
where
\[
C_1 = \frac{\varepsilon_0 k A}{t}
\]
and
\[
C_2 = \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{d-t}
\]

Substituting these into the equation for the effective capacitance:
\[
\frac{1}{C} = \frac{t}{\varepsilon_0 k A} + \frac{d-t}{\varepsilon_0 A}
\]

Simplifying, we find:
\[
C = \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{\frac{t}{k} + (d-t)}
\]

If a metal of thickness $t$ is introduced instead of the dielectric, the capacitor is effectively split into two capacitors in series: one with thickness $t$ (the metal) and the other with thickness $d-t$. The capacitance of a metal is very large, so the effective capacitance is dominated by the air gap:
\[
C_{\text{metal}} = \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{d-t}
\]

Thus, the introduction of the metal increases the capacitance compared to the dielectric case, as the effective thickness of the capacitor is reduced to $d-t$.

11.72,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor:

\[
C = \frac{\varepsilon_r \varepsilon_0 A}{d}

- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( \varepsilon_r \) is the dielectric constant,
- \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the vacuum permittivity (\(8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m}\)),
- \( A \) is the area of the plates,
- \( d \) is the separation between the plates.

Given:
- \( C = 0.1 \, \mu\text{F} = 0.1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \),
- \( A = 1 \, \text{m}^2 \),
- \( d = 0.001 \, \text{m} \).

We need to find the dielectric constant \( \varepsilon_r \). Rearranging the formula for \( \varepsilon_r \), we have:

\[
\varepsilon_r = \frac{C \cdot d}{\varepsilon_0 \cdot A}

Substituting the given values:

\[
\varepsilon_r = \frac{(0.1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}) \cdot (0.001 \, \text{m})}{(8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m}) \cdot (1 \, \text{m}^2)}

Calculating the above expression:

\[
\varepsilon_r = \frac{0.1 \times 10^{-9}}{8.854 \times 10^{-12}}

\[
\varepsilon_r \approx 11.3

\section*{Physics Problem}

A capacitor of capacitance \( C_1 = 5 \, \mu\text{F} \) is charged up to a potential difference \( V_1 = 250 \, \text{V} \). Its terminals are then connected to those of an uncharged capacitor of capacitance \( C_2 = 20 \, \mu\text{F} \). What would be the resulting voltage?

\section*{Solution}

When the charged capacitor is connected to the uncharged capacitor, the charge will redistribute between the two capacitors. The total charge before connection is equal to the total charge after connection.

The initial charge on the charged capacitor is given by:
\[
Q_1 = C_1 \times V_1 = 5 \, \mu\text{F} \times 250 \, \text{V} = 1250 \, \mu\text{C}
\]

After connection, let the common voltage across both capacitors be \( V_f \). The total charge is conserved, so:
\[
Q_{\text{total}} = Q_1 = (C_1 + C_2) \times V_f
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
1250 \, \mu\text{C} = (5 \, \mu\text{F} + 20 \, \mu\text{F}) \times V_f
\]

\[
1250 \, \mu\text{C} = 25 \, \mu\text{F} \times V_f
\]

Solving for \( V_f \):
\[
V_f = \frac{1250 \, \mu\text{C}}{25 \, \mu\text{F}} = 50 \, \text{V}
\]

Thus, the resulting voltage across both capacitors is \( 50 \, \text{V} \).

11.80,"To show that the force of attraction between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor is given by the formula \( F = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\varepsilon_0 A V^2}{d} \), we start by considering the energy stored in the capacitor and the work done by the electric field.

The energy \( U \) stored in a parallel plate capacitor is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
\]

where \( C \) is the capacitance of the capacitor, and \( V \) is the voltage across the plates. For a parallel plate capacitor, the capacitance \( C \) is given by:

\[
C = \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{d}
\]

Substituting the expression for \( C \) into the energy equation, we have:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{d} \right) V^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\varepsilon_0 A V^2}{d}
\]

The force of attraction \( F \) between the plates can be found by considering the change in energy with respect to the change in separation \( d \). The force is given by the negative gradient of the energy with respect to \( d \):

\[
F = -\frac{dU}{dd}
\]

Substituting the expression for \( U \):

\[
F = -\frac{d}{dd} \left( \frac{1}{2} \frac{\varepsilon_0 A V^2}{d} \right)
\]

Calculating the derivative:

\[
F = -\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 A V^2 \left( -\frac{1}{d^2} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\varepsilon_0 A V^2}{d^2}
\]

Thus, the force of attraction between the plates is:

\[
F = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\varepsilon_0 A V^2}{d}

\[
C = \frac{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}{\frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b}}

When \( b \approx a \), we can use the approximation for small differences, \( b = a + d \) where \( d \ll a \). The expression for the capacitance becomes:

\[
C = \frac{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}{\frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{a+d}}

Using the binomial expansion for the term \( \frac{1}{a+d} \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{a+d} \approx \frac{1}{a} - \frac{d}{a^2}

Substituting this approximation into the capacitance formula gives:

\[
C \approx \frac{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}{\frac{1}{a} - \left( \frac{1}{a} - \frac{d}{a^2} \right)} = \frac{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}{\frac{d}{a^2}}

    \caption{Circuit diagram for the capacitor problem.}
    \label{fig:11_13}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

The energy stored in a capacitor as a function of time \( t \) is given by:

\[
E(t) = E_0 \left(1 - e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}\right)^2
\]

where \( E_0 \) is the maximum energy stored at equilibrium, and \( \tau \) is the time constant of the circuit.

We want to find the time \( t \) when the energy \( E(t) \) is half of its equilibrium value \( E_0 \):

\[
E(t) = \frac{1}{2} E_0
\]

Substituting the expression for \( E(t) \):

\[
E_0 \left(1 - e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} E_0
\]

Dividing both sides by \( E_0 \):

\[
\left(1 - e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
1 - e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Solving for \( e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} \):

\[
e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{t}{\tau} = \ln\left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
t = -\tau \ln\left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
\]

Thus, the time \( t \) in terms of the time constant \( \tau \) is:

\[
t \approx 0.48 \tau
\]

Therefore, the energy stored in the capacitor reaches one-half of its equilibrium value after approximately \( 0.48 \) time constants.
