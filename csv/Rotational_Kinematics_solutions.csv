Consider the parametric equations:

    x &= a \cos t \label{eq:x} \\
    y &= a \sin t \label{eq:y} \\
    z &= t \label{eq:z}

Squaring equations \eqref{eq:x} and \eqref{eq:y} and adding them, we have:

Given the acceleration:
\[

\]

To find the velocity \( v \), integrate with respect to time:
\[
v = \int dv = k_2 r \int t^2 \, dt = k_2 r \frac{t^3}{3} + C
\]

Assuming the constant of integration \( C = 0 \) for simplicity, the velocity becomes:
\[
v = \frac{k_2 r t^3}{3}
\]

The power \( P \) is given by:
\[
P = Fv = mav
\]

Substituting \( a = k_2 r t^2 \) and \( v = \frac{k_2 r t^3}{3} \), we have:
\[
P = m \left(k_2 r t^2\right) \left(\frac{k_2 r t^3}{3}\right)

\section*{Physics Problem and Solution}

\subsection*{(a)}

The position in polar coordinates is given by:
\[
x = r \cos \theta, \quad y = r \sin \theta
\]
The position vector \(\vec{r}\) can be expressed as:
\[
\vec{r} = \hat{i}x + \hat{j}y = \hat{i}(r \cos \theta) + \hat{j}(r \sin \theta)
\]
where \(\theta = \omega t\) is the angle which the radius vector makes with the \(x\)-axis and \(\omega\) is the angular speed. Thus, we have:
\[
\vec{r} = \hat{i}(r \cos \omega t) + \hat{j}(r \sin \omega t)
\]

\subsection*{(b)}

The velocity vector \(\dot{\vec{r}}\) is given by differentiating \(\vec{r}\) with respect to time:
\[
\dot{\vec{r}} = \frac{d}{dt}(\hat{i}(r \cos \omega t) + \hat{j}(r \sin \omega t)) = -\hat{i}(\omega r \sin \omega t) + \hat{j}(\omega r \cos \omega t)
\]

The acceleration vector \(\vec{a} = \ddot{\vec{r}}\) is obtained by differentiating \(\dot{\vec{r}}\) with respect to time:
\[
\vec{a} = \frac{d}{dt}(-\hat{i}(\omega r \sin \omega t) + \hat{j}(\omega r \cos \omega t)) = -\hat{i}(\omega^2 r \cos \omega t) - \hat{j}(\omega^2 r \sin \omega t)
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
\vec{a} = -\omega^2 r (\hat{i} \cos \omega t + \hat{j} \sin \omega t) = -\omega^2 (\hat{i}x + \hat{j}y)
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
\vec{a} = -\omega^2 \vec{r}
\]

This relation shows that due to the minus sign, \(\vec{a}\) is oppositely directed to \(\vec{r}\), i.e., \(\vec{a}\) is directed radially inwards.

Given the acceleration \( a \) as the vector sum of its normal and tangential components:

\[
a = \sqrt{a_N^2 + a_T^2} \quad \text{(see Fig. 3.9)}
\]

We know that:

\[

The tangential acceleration is given by:

\[
a_T = \alpha R \tag{2}

The angular velocity is:

Let a particle of mass $m$ be placed at $A$, the highest point on a sphere of radius $R$ with the center at $O$. Let it slide down from rest along the arc of the great circle and leave the surface at $B$, at depth $h$ below $A$, as shown in Fig. 3.16. Let the radius $OB$ make an angle $\theta$ with the vertical line $OA$. The centripetal force experienced by the particle at $B$ is $\frac{mv^2}{R}$, where $v$ is the velocity of the particle at this point. 

Now, the weight $mg$ of the particle acts vertically downwards, so that its component along the radius $BO$ is $mg \cos \theta$. As long as $mg \cos \theta > \frac{mv^2}{R}$, the particle will stick to the surface. The condition that the particle will leave the surface is:

\begin{equation}
mg \cos \theta = \frac{mv^2}{R}
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
\cos \theta = \frac{v^2}{gR}

Now, in descending from $A$ to $B$, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy:

Measure potential energy from the equilibrium position \( B \), as shown in Fig. 3.17. At the equilibrium position, the total mechanical energy \( E \) is given by:

\[
E = mgL

where the pendulum is at rest. As it passes through point \( C \), let its speed be \( v \). The potential energy will be \( mgh \), where \( h = BD \) and \( CD \) is perpendicular to the vertical \( OB \).

Now, the height \( h \) can be expressed as:

\[
h = L - L\cos\theta = L(1 - \cos\theta) \tag{1}
\]

Applying energy conservation, we have:

\[
mgL = mgL(1 - \cos\theta) + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \tag{2}

The tension in the string at \( C \) will be:

\[
T = \frac{mv^2}{L} + mg\cos\theta \tag{3}

According to the problem, the tension \( T \) is equal to \( mg \):
