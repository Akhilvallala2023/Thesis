12.2,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the resistance of a wire and its physical dimensions. The resistance \( R \) of a wire is given by the formula:

\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]

where:
- \( R \) is the resistance,
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material,
- \( L \) is the length of the wire,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

When the wire is stretched to make it 0.1% longer, the new length \( L' \) is:

\[
L' = L + 0.001L = 1.001L
\]

Since the volume of the wire remains constant during stretching, we have:

\[
L \cdot A = L' \cdot A'
\]

Thus, the new cross-sectional area \( A' \) is:

\[
A' = \frac{L \cdot A}{L'} = \frac{L \cdot A}{1.001L} = \frac{A}{1.001}
\]

The new resistance \( R' \) is:

\[
R' = \rho \frac{L'}{A'} = \rho \frac{1.001L}{\frac{A}{1.001}} = \rho \frac{1.001^2 L}{A}
\]

The percentage change in resistance is given by:

\[
\text{Percentage change in resistance} = \left( \frac{R' - R}{R} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Substituting the values of \( R' \) and \( R \):

\[
\frac{R' - R}{R} = \frac{\rho \frac{1.001^2 L}{A} - \rho \frac{L}{A}}{\rho \frac{L}{A}} = \frac{1.001^2 - 1}{1} = 1.001^2 - 1
\]

Calculating \( 1.001^2 \):

\[
1.001^2 = 1.002001
\]

Thus, the percentage change in resistance is:

\[
\text{Percentage change} = (1.002001 - 1) \times 100\% = 0.2001\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage change in the resistance of the copper wire when it is stretched to make it 0.1% longer is approximately \( 0.2\% \).

\section*{Problem}

If a copper wire is stretched to make it 0.1\% longer, what is the percentage change in its resistance? [Indian Institute of Technology 1978]

\section*{Solution}

The resistance \( R \) of a wire is given by the formula:
\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( R \) is the resistance,
    \item \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material,
    \item \( L \) is the length of the wire,
    \item \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.
\end{itemize}

When the wire is stretched to make it 0.1\% longer, the new length \( L' \) is:
\[
L' = L + 0.001L = 1.001L
\]

Since the volume of the wire remains constant during stretching, we have:
\[
L \cdot A = L' \cdot A'
\]
Thus, the new cross-sectional area \( A' \) is:
\[
A' = \frac{L \cdot A}{L'} = \frac{L \cdot A}{1.001L} = \frac{A}{1.001}
\]

The new resistance \( R' \) is:
\[
R' = \rho \frac{L'}{A'} = \rho \frac{1.001L}{\frac{A}{1.001}} = \rho \frac{1.001^2 L}{A}
\]

The percentage change in resistance is given by:
\[
\text{Percentage change in resistance} = \left( \frac{R' - R}{R} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Substituting the values of \( R' \) and \( R \):
\[
\frac{R' - R}{R} = \frac{\rho \frac{1.001^"

\begin{document}

The equivalent resistance of the series combination of two resistors is \( p \). When they are joined in parallel, the equivalent resistance is \( q \). If \( p = n q \), find the minimum possible value of \( n \).

\section*{Solution}

Let the resistances of the two resistors be \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \).

For resistors in series, the equivalent resistance is given by:
\[
p = R_1 + R_2
\]

For resistors in parallel, the equivalent resistance is given by:
\[
\frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
q = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
\]

Given that \( p = n q \), we substitute the expressions for \( p \) and \( q \):
\[
R_1 + R_2 = n \left(\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}\right)
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( R_1 + R_2 \), we get:
\[
(R_1 + R_2)^2 = n R_1 R_2
\]

Rearranging gives:
\[
n = \frac{(R_1 + R_2)^2}{R_1 R_2}
\]

To find the minimum possible value of \( n \), we apply the AM-GM inequality:
\[
R_1 + R_2 \geq 2\sqrt{R_1 R_2}
\]

Squaring both sides:
\[
(R_1 + R_2)^2 \geq 4R_1 R_2
\]

Thus:
\[
n = \frac{(R_1 + R_2)^2}{R_1 R_2} \geq 4
\]

Therefore, the minimum possible value of \( n \) is \( \boxed{4} \).

Five resistors are connected as shown in Fig. 12.4. Find the equivalent resistance between points A and C.

    \caption{Circuit diagram with five resistors.}
    \label{fig:circuit}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

To find the equivalent resistance between points A and C, we need to analyze the configuration of the resistors in the circuit. Depending on whether they are in series or parallel, we can use the following formulas:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For resistors in series: 
    \[
    R_{\text{eq, series}} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_n
    \]
    \item For resistors in parallel:
    \[
    \frac{1}{R_{\text{eq, parallel}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n}
    \]
\end{itemize}

Assuming the resistors are configured in a combination of series and parallel, calculate the equivalent resistance step by step:

1. Identify resistors in series and calculate their combined resistance.
2. Identify resistors in parallel and calculate their combined resistance.
3. Repeat the process until you find the total equivalent resistance between points A and C.

R_{\text{eq, AC}} = \ldots

\section*{Problem}

Determine the equal length of an iron wire and a constantan wire, each with a diameter of 1 mm, that must be joined in parallel to achieve an equivalent resistance of \(2 \, \Omega\). The resistivity of iron is \(10 \, \mu\Omega \cdot \text{cm}\) and the resistivity of constantan is \(49 \, \mu\Omega \cdot \text{cm}\).

\section*{Solution}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Diameter of each wire, \(d = 1 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{cm}\)
    \item Resistivity of iron, \(\rho_{\text{iron}} = 10 \, \mu\Omega \cdot \text{cm}\)
    \item Resistivity of constantan, \(\rho_{\text{constantan}} = 49 \, \mu\Omega \cdot \text{cm}\)
    \item Equivalent resistance, \(R_{\text{eq}} = 2 \, \Omega\)
\end{itemize}

The resistance \(R\) of a wire is given by:
\[
R = \frac{\rho \cdot L}{A}
\]
where \(L\) is the length of the wire and \(A\) is the cross-sectional area. The cross-sectional area \(A\) of the wire is:
\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{0.1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi}{400} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

For wires in parallel, the equivalent resistance is given by:
\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_{\text{iron}}} + \frac{1}{R_{\text{constantan}}}
\]

Substitute the resistance formula for each wire:
\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{A}{\rho_{\text{iron}} \cdot L} + \frac{A}{\rho_{\text{constantan}} \cdot L}
\]

Substitute the given values:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\frac{\pi}{400}}{10 \cdot L} + \frac{\frac{\pi}{400}}{49 \cdot L}
\]

Simplify and solve for \(L\):
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\pi}{400L} \left(\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{49}\right)
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\pi}{400L} \left(\frac{49 + 10}{490}\right)
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\pi \times 59}{400 \times 490 \times L}
\]

\[
L = \frac{\pi \times 59}{400 \times 490 \times \frac{1}{2}}
\]

\[
L = \frac{59 \times \pi}{98000}
\]

Thus, the required length \(L\) of each wire is:
\[
L \approx \frac{59 \times 3.1416}{98000} \approx 0.00189 \, \text{cm}
\]

Therefore, the length of each wire must be approximately \(0.00189 \, \text{cm}\).

\[
\alpha = \frac{R_2 - R_1}{R_1 \times (T_2 - T_1)}

T_1 &= \SI{25}{\degreeCelsius} \\

\[
\alpha = \frac{\SI{25.7}{\ohm} - \SI{20}{\ohm}}{\SI{20}{\ohm} \times (\SI{100}{\degreeCelsius} - \SI{25}{\degreeCelsius})}
\]

\[
\alpha = \frac{\SI{5.7}{\ohm}}{\SI{20}{\ohm} \times \SI{75}{\degreeCelsius}}
\]

\[
\alpha = \frac{\SI{5.7}{\ohm}}{\SI{1500}{\ohm \degreeCelsius}}
\]

\[
\alpha = \SI{0.0038}{\per\degreeCelsius}

Thus, the temperature coefficient of resistance is \(\alpha = \SI{0.0038}{\per\degreeCelsius}\).

\begin{document}

\section*{Problem Statement}

A wire of resistance \(0.1 \, \Omega/\text{cm}\) is bent to form a square \(ABCD\) with side \(10 \, \text{cm}\). A similar wire is connected between the corners \(B\) and \(D\) to form the diagonal \(BD\). Find the effective resistance of this combination between \(A\) and \(C\). A battery of negligible internal resistance is connected across \(A\) and \(C\). Calculate the total power dissipated.

\section*{Solution}

First, calculate the resistance of each side of the square. Since each side is \(10 \, \text{cm}\) and the resistance per cm is \(0.1 \, \Omega/\text{cm}\), the resistance of each side is:
\[
R_{\text{side}} = 10 \, \text{cm} \times 0.1 \, \Omega/\text{cm} = 1 \, \Omega
\]

The diagonal \(BD\) is formed by a similar wire of length:
\[
BD = \sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2} \, \text{cm}
\]

The resistance of the diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
R_{\text{BD}} = 10\sqrt{2} \, \text{cm} \times 0.1 \, \Omega/\text{cm} = \sqrt{2} \, \Omega
\]

Now, consider the circuit formed by these resistances. The resistances \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) are each \(1 \, \Omega\). The diagonal \(BD\) is \(\sqrt{2} \, \Omega\).

The resistances between \(A\) and \(C\) are:
- \(R_{AC1} = R_{AB} + R_{BC} = 1 \, \Omega + 1 \, \Omega = 2 \, \Omega\)
- \(R_{AC2} = R_{AD} + R_{DC} = 1 \, \Omega + 1 \, \Omega = 2 \, \Omega\)

These two paths are in parallel with the diagonal \(BD\), so the effective resistance \(R_{\text{eff}}\) between \(A\) and \(C\) is given by:
\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{1}{R_{AC1}} + \frac{1}{R_{AC2}} + \frac{1}{R_{\text{BD}}}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eff}}} = 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
\[
R_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} + 1} \, \Omega
\]

Now, calculate the total power dissipated when a battery is connected across \(A\) and \(C\). Let the voltage of the battery be \(V\).

The power dissipated \(P\) is given by:
\[
P = \frac{V^2}{R_{\text{eff}}}
\]

Substitute the value of \(R_{\text{eff}}\):
\[
P = \frac{V^2 (\sqrt{2} + 1)}{\sqrt{2}} \, \text{W}
\]

This completes the solution to the problem.

\section*{Problem}

A \SI{60}{\watt} - \SI{100}{\volt} tungsten lamp has a resistance of \SI{20}{\ohm} at air temperature (\SI{0}{\degreeCelsius}). What is the rise in temperature of the filament under normal working conditions? The temperature coefficient of resistance of tungsten is \SI{0.0052}{\per\degreeCelsius}. \textit{[University of London]}

\section*{Solution}

To find the rise in temperature of the filament, we use the formula for the resistance of a material as a function of temperature:

\begin{equation}
    R = R_0 (1 + \alpha \Delta T)
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{align*}
    R & = \text{resistance at the working temperature} \\
    R_0 & = \text{resistance at \SI{0}{\degreeCelsius}} = \SI{20}{\ohm} \\
    \alpha & = \text{temperature coefficient of resistance} = \SI{0.0052}{\per\degreeCelsius} \\
    \Delta T & = \text{rise in temperature}
\end{align*}

The power \( P \) is given by

\begin{equation}
    P = \frac{V^2}{R}
\end{equation}

where \( P = \SI{60}{\watt} \) and \( V = \SI{100}{\volt} \).

Rearranging for \( R \), we have:

\begin{equation}
    R = \frac{V^2}{P} = \frac{(100)^2}{60} = \SI{166.67}{\ohm}
\end{equation}

Substituting \( R \) and \( R_0 \) into the resistance-temperature equation:

\begin{equation}
    166.67 = 20 (1 + 0.0052 \Delta T)
\end{equation}

Solving for \( \Delta T \):

\begin{align*}
    166.67 &= 20 + 20 \times 0.0052 \Delta T \\
    166.67 - 20 &= 20 \times 0.0052 \Delta T \\
    146.67 &= 0.104 \Delta T \\
    \Delta T &= \frac{146.67}{0.104} \approx \SI{1410.29}{\degreeCelsius}
\end{align*}

Thus, the rise in temperature of the filament under normal working conditions is approximately \SI{1410.29}{\degreeCelsius}.

A skeleton cube is made of wires soldered together at the corners of the cube, with the resistance of each wire being $10 \, \Omega$. A current of $6 \, \text{A}$ enters at one corner (see Fig. 12.11) and leaves the diagonally opposite corner. Calculate the equivalent resistance of the network and the fall of potential across it.

The current enters at one corner and exits at the diagonally opposite corner. Due to symmetry, the problem can be simplified by considering the cube as a network of resistors with symmetrical paths for the current.

The equivalent resistance between two diagonally opposite corners of a cube made of identical resistors can be calculated using the symmetry of the cube. The equivalent resistance $R_{\text{eq}}$ is given by:

\[
R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{5}{6} \times R
\]

where $R = 10 \, \Omega$ is the resistance of each wire.

Thus, the equivalent resistance is:

\[
R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{5}{6} \times 10 \, \Omega = \frac{50}{6} \, \Omega \approx 8.33 \, \Omega
\]

Next, we calculate the potential difference (fall of potential) across the cube using Ohm's Law:

\[
V = I \times R_{\text{eq}}
\]

where $I = 6 \, \text{A}$ is the current.

\[
V = 6 \, \text{A} \times 8.33 \, \Omega = 49.98 \, \text{V}
\]

Therefore, the fall of potential across the cube is approximately $50 \, \text{V}$.

\section*{Conclusion}

The equivalent resistance of the network is approximately $8.33 \, \Omega$, and the fall of potential across it is approximately $50 \, \text{V}$.

\section*{Problem Statement}

Two bulbs, \(A_2\) with a power rating of 5 W and \(B_1\) with a power rating of 100 W, are connected in series and joined to the mains (see Fig. \ref{fig:bulbs}). Which bulb will glow brighter? \\

    \caption{Circuit diagram of bulbs connected in series.}
    \label{fig:bulbs}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

When two bulbs are connected in series, the same current flows through both bulbs. The brightness of a bulb is determined by the power it dissipates, which is given by \(P = I^2 R\), where \(I\) is the current and \(R\) is the resistance of the bulb.

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bulb \(A_2\): 5 W
    \item Bulb \(B_1\): 100 W
\end{itemize}

Assuming both bulbs are rated for the same voltage, the resistance \(R\) of each bulb can be calculated using the formula \(P = \frac{V^2}{R}\), where \(V\) is the voltage rating of the bulb.

The bulb with the higher resistance will dissipate more power when connected in series, as the current is constant. Therefore, the bulb with the lower power rating (5 W) will have a higher resistance and will glow brighter.

Thus, bulb \(A_2\) will glow brighter than bulb \(B_1\).

\title{Physics Problem: Potential Drop Across Parallel Resistors}
\author{University of Newcastle}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem}

Three resistors of \SI{4}{\ohm}, \SI{6}{\ohm}, and \SI{12}{\ohm} are connected together in parallel. This parallel arrangement is then connected in series with \SI{1}{\ohm} and \SI{2}{\ohm} resistors. If a potential difference of \SI{120}{V} is applied across the end of the circuit, what will be the potential drop across the part of the circuit connected in parallel?

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we first calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel resistors. The formula for the equivalent resistance \( R_p \) of resistors in parallel is given by:

\[
\frac{1}{R_p} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{1}{R_p} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{12}
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{1}{R_p} = \frac{3}{12} + \frac{2}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the equivalent resistance of the parallel resistors is:

\[
R_p = 2 \, \Omega
\]

Next, we calculate the total resistance of the circuit. The total resistance \( R_t \) is the sum of the equivalent parallel resistance and the series resistors:

\[
R_t = R_p + R_4 + R_5 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 \, \Omega
\]

The total current \( I \) flowing through the circuit is given by Ohm's Law:

\[
I = \frac{V}{R_t} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \, \text{A}
\]

The potential drop \( V_p \) across the parallel section is:

\[
V_p = I \times R_p = 24 \times 2 = 48 \, \text{V}
\]

Therefore, the potential drop across the part of the circuit connected in parallel is \SI{48}{V}.

\section*{Problem}

Two heater coils of power $P_1$ and $P_2$ (resistance $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectively) take individually time $t_1$ and $t_2$ to boil a fixed quantity of water. Find the time $t$ in terms of $t_1$ and $t_2$, when they are connected to the mains in (a) series and (b) parallel to boil the same quantity of water.

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Series Connection}

When the coils are connected in series, the total resistance $R_s$ is given by:
\[
R_s = R_1 + R_2
\]

The power in series connection $P_s$ is given by:
\[
P_s = \frac{V^2}{R_s} = \frac{V^2}{R_1 + R_2}
\]

The energy required to boil the water is the same in both cases, so:
\[
P_1 t_1 = P_s t
\]

Substituting for $P_1$ and $P_s$, we have:
\[
\frac{V^2}{R_1} t_1 = \frac{V^2}{R_1 + R_2} t
\]

Solving for $t$, we get:
\[
t = t_1 \left( \frac{R_1 + R_2}{R_1} \right)
\]

Similarly, using $P_2 t_2 = P_s t$, we find:
\[
t = t_2 \left( \frac{R_1 + R_2}{R_2} \right)
\]

Thus, the time $t$ in series is:
\[
t = \frac{t_1 R_2 + t_2 R_1}{R_1 + R_2}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Parallel Connection}

When the coils are connected in parallel, the total resistance $R_p$ is given by:
\[
\frac{1}{R_p} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
\]

The power in parallel connection $P_p$ is given by:
\[
P_p = \frac{V^2}{R_p}
\]

The energy required to boil the water is the same, so:
\[
P_1 t_1 = P_p t
\]

Substituting for $P_1$ and $P_p$, we have:
\[
\frac{V^2}{R_1} t_1 = \frac{V^2}{R_p} t
\]

Solving for $t$, we get:
\[
t = t_1 \left( \frac{R_p}{R_1} \right)
\]

Similarly, using $P_2 t_2 = P_p t$, we find:
\[
t = t_2 \left( \frac{R_p}{R_2} \right)
\]

Thus, the time $t$ in parallel is:
\[
t = \frac{t_1 t_2}{t_1 + t_2}
\]

\title{Physics Problem: Power Expended in Resistances}
\author{University of London}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

A battery having an electromotive force (emf) of \SI{24}{\volt} and an internal resistance of \SI{2}{\ohm} is connected to two resistances arranged (a) in series and (b) in parallel. If the resistances are \SI{4}{\ohm} and \SI{6}{\ohm}, respectively, calculate the watts expended in each resistance, in each of the two cases.

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Series Connection}

In a series connection, the total resistance \( R_{\text{total}} \) is the sum of all resistances:

\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{internal}} + R_1 + R_2 = 2 + 4 + 6 = \SI{12}{\ohm}
\]

The current \( I \) through the circuit is given by Ohm's law:

\[
I = \frac{V_{\text{emf}}}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{24}{12} = \SI{2}{\ampere}
\]

The power expended in each resistance is given by \( P = I^2 R \).

For the \SI{4}{\ohm} resistor:

\[
P_1 = I^2 R_1 = (2)^2 \times 4 = \SI{16}{\watt}
\]

For the \SI{6}{\ohm} resistor:

\[
P_2 = I^2 R_2 = (2)^2 \times 6 = \SI{24}{\watt}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Parallel Connection}

In a parallel connection, the total resistance \( R_{\text{total}} \) is given by:

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_{\text{internal}}} + \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6}
\]

Calculating the total resistance:

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{6 + 3 + 2}{12} = \frac{11}{12}
\]

Thus,

\[
R_{\text{total}} = \frac{12}{11} \approx \SI{1.09}{\ohm}
\]

The total current \( I \) is:

\[
I = \frac{V_{\text{emf}}}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{24}{\frac{12}{11}} = \frac{24 \times 11}{12} = \SI{22}{\ampere}
\]

The voltage across each resistor in parallel is the same as the emf minus the voltage drop across the internal resistance:

\[
V_{\text{across}} = V_{\text{emf}} - I \times R_{\text{internal}} = 24 - 22 \times 2 = \SI{20}{\volt}
\]

The power expended in each resistance is given by \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \).

For the \SI{4}{\ohm} resistor:

\[
P_1 = \frac{V_{\text{across}}^2}{R_1} = \frac{20^2}{4} = \SI{100}{\watt}
\]

For the \SI{6}{\ohm} resistor:

\[
P_2 = \frac{V_{\text{across}}^2}{R_2} = \frac{20^2}{6} \approx \SI{66.67}{\watt}
\]

\section*{Problem Statement}

Power at the rate of \(104 \, \text{kW}\) has to be supplied through \(30 \, \text{km}\) of cable with a resistance of \(0.7 \, \Omega/\text{km}\). Find the rate of energy loss if the power is transmitted at \(100 \, \text{kV}\).

\section*{Solution}

Given:
\begin{align*}
    P &= 104 \, \text{kW} = 104 \times 10^3 \, \text{W}, \\
    L &= 30 \, \text{km}, \\
    R_{\text{per km}} &= 0.7 \, \Omega/\text{km}, \\
    V &= 100 \, \text{kV} = 100 \times 10^3 \, \text{V}.
\end{align*}

The total resistance \(R\) of the cable is given by:
\[
R = R_{\text{per km}} \times L = 0.7 \, \Omega/\text{km} \times 30 \, \text{km} = 21 \, \Omega.
\]

The current \(I\) flowing through the cable can be calculated using the formula for power:
\[
P = VI \implies I = \frac{P}{V} = \frac{104 \times 10^3 \, \text{W}}{100 \times 10^3 \, \text{V}} = 1.04 \, \text{A}.
\]

The rate of energy loss due to the resistance in the cable is given by:
\[
P_{\text{loss}} = I^2 R = (1.04 \, \text{A})^2 \times 21 \, \Omega = 22.7136 \, \text{W}.
\]

Therefore, the rate of energy loss is approximately \(22.71 \, \text{W}\).

\section*{Problem}

Three equal resistors, connected in series across a source of emf, together dissipate 10 W of power. What would be the power dissipated if the same resistors are connected in parallel across the same source of emf? [Indian Institute of Technology 1972]

\section*{Solution}

Let the resistance of each resistor be \( R \). When connected in series, the total resistance \( R_s \) is given by:
\[
R_s = R + R + R = 3R
\]

Let the emf of the source be \( V \). The power dissipated in the series connection is given by:
\[
P_s = \frac{V^2}{R_s} = \frac{V^2}{3R} = 10 \, \text{W}
\]

From this, we can express \( V^2 \) in terms of \( R \):
\[
V^2 = 30R
\]

Now, consider the resistors connected in parallel. The total resistance \( R_p \) for resistors in parallel is:
\[
\frac{1}{R_p} = \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{R} = \frac{3}{R}
\]
\[
R_p = \frac{R}{3}
\]

The power dissipated in the parallel connection is given by:
\[
P_p = \frac{V^2}{R_p} = \frac{V^2}{\frac{R}{3}} = 3 \cdot \frac{V^2}{R}
\]

Substituting the expression for \( V^2 \) from the series connection:
\[
P_p = 3 \cdot \frac{30R}{R} = 90 \, \text{W}
\]

Thus, the power dissipated when the resistors are connected in parallel is \(\boxed{90 \, \text{W}}\).

For the heater to operate at $62.5 \, \text{W}$, we have:
\[
62.5 = \frac{100^2}{R_{\text{total}}}

Solving for $R_{\text{total}}$:
\[
R_{\text{total}} = \frac{100^2}{62.5} = 160 \, \Omega

The total resistance $R_{\text{total}}$ is the sum of the resistances in series:
\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R

Substituting the known values:
\[
160 = 100 + R

\section*{Problem}

Twelve cells having the same emf are connected in series and are kept in a closed box. Some of the cells are wrongly connected. This battery is connected in series with an ammeter and two cells identical with others. The current is 3 A when the cells and the battery aid each other and is 2 A when the cells and the battery oppose each other. How many cells in the battery are wrongly connected? [Indian Institute of Technology 1976]

\section*{Solution}

Let the emf of each cell be \( E \) and the internal resistance of each cell be \( r \).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( n \) be the number of cells wrongly connected.
    \item The effective emf when all cells aid each other is \( (12 - 2n)E + 2E \).
    \item The effective emf when the cells and the battery oppose each other is \( (12 - 2n)E - 2E \).
\end{itemize}

The total internal resistance of the battery is \( 14r \) (since there are 12 cells in the battery and 2 external cells).

Using Ohm's Law \( V = IR \), we have:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{(12 - 2n)E + 2E}{14r} = 3 \quad \text{(when aiding)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{(12 - 2n)E - 2E}{14r} = 2 \quad \text{(when opposing)}
\end{equation}

Solving these equations:

\begin{align*}
    (12 - 2n)E + 2E &= 42r \\
    (12 - 2n)E - 2E &= 28r
\end{align*}

Subtract the second equation from the first:

\begin{align*}
    [(12 - 2n)E + 2E] - [(12 - 2n)E - 2E] &= 42r - 28r \\
    4E &= 14r \\
    E &= \frac{7r}{2}
\end{align*}

Substitute \( E = \frac{7r}{2} \) into one of the original equations:

\begin{align*}
    (12 - 2n)\left(\frac{7r}{2}\right) + 2\left(\frac{7r}{2}\right) &= 42r \\
    (12 - 2n) \cdot \frac{7}{2} + 7 &= 42 \\
    42 - 7n + 7 &= 42 \\
    49 - 7n &= 42 \\
    7 &= 7n \\
    n &= 1

Consider a configuration of cells arranged in a grid with $m$ rows, each containing $n$ cells in series. Each cell has an internal resistance $r$. We aim to show that the maximum current in the external resistance $R$ is achieved when $R = \frac{nr}{m}$.

\section*{Solution}

The total internal resistance of one row of $n$ cells in series is given by:
\[
R_{\text{internal, row}} = nr
\]

Since there are $m$ rows in parallel, the equivalent internal resistance $R_{\text{internal, total}}$ is:
\[
R_{\text{internal, total}} = \frac{nr}{m}
\]

The total resistance in the circuit, including the external resistance $R$, is:
\[
R_{\text{total}} = R + \frac{nr}{m}
\]

The current $I$ through the external resistance $R$ can be expressed using Ohm's Law:
\[
I = \frac{V}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{V}{R + \frac{nr}{m}}
\]

To maximize the current $I$, we differentiate $I$ with respect to $R$ and set the derivative equal to zero:
\[
\frac{dI}{dR} = \frac{d}{dR} \left( \frac{V}{R + \frac{nr}{m}} \right) = 0
\]

Solving this equation, we find that the maximum current occurs when:
\[
R = \frac{nr}{m}

Thus, the maximum current in the external resistance $R$ is achieved when $R = \frac{nr}{m}$.

Two cells with the same electromotive force (emf) $\mathcal{E}$ and internal resistances $r_1$ and $r_2$ are connected in series to an external resistance $R$. Find the value of $R$ so that the potential difference across the first cell is zero.

\section*{Solution}

When the two cells are connected in series, the total emf of the system is $2\mathcal{E}$, and the total internal resistance is $r_1 + r_2$. The total resistance in the circuit is $R + r_1 + r_2$.

The current $I$ flowing through the circuit can be calculated using Ohm's law:

\[
I = \frac{2\mathcal{E}}{R + r_1 + r_2}
\]

For the potential difference across the first cell to be zero, the voltage drop across its internal resistance $r_1$ must equal its emf $\mathcal{E}$. Thus, we have:

\[
\mathcal{E} = I \cdot r_1
\]

Substituting the expression for $I$, we get:

\mathcal{E} = \frac{2\mathcal{E} \cdot r_1}{R + r_1 + r_2}
\]

Solving for $R$, we rearrange the equation:

\[
R + r_1 + r_2 = 2r_1
\]

\[
R = 2r_1 - r_1 - r_2
\]

\[
R = r_1 - r_2
\]

Thus, the value of $R$ that makes the potential difference across the first cell zero is:

\[
R = r_1 - r_2

\section*{Physics Problem}

A certain circuit consists of three resistors connected in parallel across 200 V mains. The rate of production of heat in them is in the ratio of 5:3:2, and together they generate heat at the rate of 1 kWh in 2 hours. Find the power used if the three resistances are connected in series across 248 V mains. [Northern Universities of UK]

\section*{Solution}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Voltage across parallel connection: \( V = 200 \, \text{V} \)
    \item Heat generation ratio: \( 5:3:2 \)
    \item Total heat generated: \( 1 \, \text{kWh in 2 hours} \)
\end{itemize}

First, calculate the total power generated in the parallel connection:
\[
\text{Total energy} = 1 \, \text{kWh} = 1000 \, \text{Wh}
\]
\[
\text{Total power} = \frac{1000 \, \text{Wh}}{2 \, \text{h}} = 500 \, \text{W}
\]

Let the power dissipated in the resistors be \( P_1, P_2, \) and \( P_3 \) such that:
\[
P_1 : P_2 : P_3 = 5:3:2
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
P_1 = 5x, \quad P_2 = 3x, \quad P_3 = 2x
\]
\[
5x + 3x + 2x = 500
\]
\[
10x = 500 \implies x = 50
\]

Therefore, the individual powers are:
\[
P_1 = 250 \, \text{W}, \quad P_2 = 150 \, \text{W}, \quad P_3 = 100 \, \text{W}
\]

Now, find the resistances \( R_1, R_2, \) and \( R_3 \):
\[
P = \frac{V^2}{R} \implies R = \frac{V^2}{P}
\]
\[
R_1 = \frac{200^2}{250} = 160 \, \Omega, \quad R_2 = \frac{200^2}{150} \approx 266.67 \, \Omega, \quad R_3 = \frac{200^2}{100} = 400 \, \Omega
\]

When connected in series across 248 V:
\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 160 + 266.67 + 400 = 826.67 \, \Omega
\]

The total power used in series connection:
\[
P_{\text{series}} = \frac{V^2}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{248^2}{826.67} \approx 74.4 \, \text{W}
\]

Thus, the power used when the resistors are connected in series across 248 V mains is approximately \( 74.4 \, \text{W} \).

\maketitle

\section*{Problem}

A battery of electromotive force $E = 2 \, \text{V}$ and internal resistance $r = 0.1 \, \Omega$ is being charged with a current of $I = 5 \, \text{A}$. In what direction will the current flow inside the battery? What is the potential difference between the two terminals of the battery?

\section*{Solution}

When a battery is being charged, the current flows into the positive terminal of the battery. Therefore, inside the battery, the current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.

To find the potential difference between the two terminals of the battery, we use the formula for the terminal voltage $V$ of a battery being charged:

\[
V = E + Ir
\]

where:
\begin{align*}
E & = 2 \, \text{V} \quad \text{(electromotive force)}, \\
I & = 5 \, \text{A} \quad \text{(current)}, \\
r & = 0.1 \, \Omega \quad \text{(internal resistance)}.
\end{align*}

Substituting the given values into the equation, we have:

\[
V = 2 \, \text{V} + (5 \, \text{A})(0.1 \, \Omega) = 2 \, \text{V} + 0.5 \, \text{V} = 2.5 \, \text{V}
\]

Thus, the potential difference between the two terminals of the battery is $2.5 \, \text{V}$.

\section*{Problem Statement}

A 6 V battery of negligible internal resistance is connected in series with a $3\,\Omega$ and a $5\,\Omega$ resistance. A further resistance of $2\,\Omega$ is connected in parallel with the $5\,\Omega$ resistance. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Find the current flowing in each resistance.
    \item[(b)] Find the power dissipated in each resistance.
    \item[(c)] Compare the total value for the power dissipated in the resistances with the value for the power supplied by the battery.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Current in Each Resistance}

First, calculate the equivalent resistance of the $5\,\Omega$ and $2\,\Omega$ resistors in parallel:

\[
R_{\text{parallel}} = \left(\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{2}\right)^{-1} = \left(\frac{2 + 5}{10}\right)^{-1} = \frac{10}{7}\,\Omega
\]

The total resistance in the circuit is then:

\[
R_{\text{total}} = 3\,\Omega + R_{\text{parallel}} = 3\,\Omega + \frac{10}{7}\,\Omega = \frac{31}{7}\,\Omega
\]

The total current supplied by the battery is:

\[
I_{\text{total}} = \frac{V}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{6\,\text{V}}{\frac{31}{7}\,\Omega} = \frac{42}{31}\,\text{A}
\]

The current through the $3\,\Omega$ resistor is the same as the total current:

\[
I_{3\Omega} = \frac{42}{31}\,\text{A}
\]

For the parallel resistors, the voltage across them is:

\[
V_{\text{parallel}} = I_{\text{total}} \times R_{\text{parallel}} = \frac{42}{31}\,\text{A} \times \frac{10}{7}\,\Omega = \frac{60}{31}\,\text{V}
\]

The current through the $5\,\Omega$ resistor is:

\[
I_{5\Omega} = \frac{V_{\text{parallel}}}{5\,\Omega} = \frac{60}{31}\,\text{V} \times \frac{1}{5}\,\Omega = \frac{12}{31}\,\text{A}
\]

The current through the $2\,\Omega$ resistor is:

\[
I_{2\Omega} = \frac{V_{\text{parallel}}}{2\,\Omega} = \frac{60}{31}\,\text{V} \times \frac{1}{2}\,\Omega = \frac{30}{31}\,\text{A}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Power Dissipated in Each Resistance}

The power dissipated in the $3\,\Omega$ resistor is:

\[
P_{3\Omega} = I_{3\Omega}^2 \times 3\,\Omega = \left(\frac{42}{31}\right)^2 \times 3\,\Omega = \frac{1764}{961} \times 3\,\Omega = \frac{5292}{961}\,\text{W}
\]

The power dissipated in the $5\,\Omega$ resistor is:

\[
P_{5\Omega} = I_{5\Omega}^2 \times 5\,\Omega = \left(\frac{12}{31}\right)^2 \times 5\,\Omega = \frac{144}{961} \times 5\,\Omega = \frac{720}{961}\,\text{W}
\]

The power dissipated in the $2\,\Omega$ resistor is:

\[
P_{2\Omega} = I_{2\Omega}^2 \times 2\,\Omega = \left(\frac{30}{31}\right)^2 \times 2\,\Omega = \frac{900}{961} \times 2\,\Omega = \frac{1800}{961}\,\text{W}
\]

\title{Physics Problem: Internal Resistance of a Cell}
\author{University of London}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

The terminals of a cell are connected to a resistance, and the fall of potential across $R$ is balanced against the fall across the potentiometer wire. When $R$ is $20 \, \Omega$ and $10 \, \Omega$, respectively, the corresponding lengths on the potentiometer are 150 cm and 120 cm. Calculate the internal resistance of the cell (Fig. 12.16).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig12_16.png} % Replace with actual image file
    \caption{Schematic of the experimental setup}
    \label{fig:12_16}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

Let $E$ be the electromotive force (emf) of the cell, $r$ be the internal resistance of the cell, and $l_1 = 150 \, \text{cm}$ and $l_2 = 120 \, \text{cm}$ be the lengths on the potentiometer wire for resistances $R_1 = 20 \, \Omega$ and $R_2 = 10 \, \Omega$, respectively.

The potential difference across the potentiometer wire is proportional to the length of the wire balanced. Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{E}{R_1 + r} = k \cdot l_1
\]

\[
\frac{E}{R_2 + r} = k \cdot l_2
\]

where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.

Dividing the two equations, we get:

\[
\frac{R_2 + r}{R_1 + r} = \frac{l_2}{l_1}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{10 + r}{20 + r} = \frac{120}{150}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{10 + r}{20 + r} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
5(10 + r) = 4(20 + r)
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
50 + 5r = 80 + 4r
\]

Solving for $r$:

\[
5r - 4r = 80 - 50
\]

\[
r = 30 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the internal resistance of the cell is $\boxed{30 \, \Omega}$.

\section*{Problem Statement}

A uniform wire of length \(50 \, \text{cm}\) and resistance \(1 \, \Omega\) is connected to the terminals of an accumulator with an electromotive force (emf) of \(2.2 \, \text{V}\) and an internal resistance of \(0.1 \, \Omega\) (see Fig. 12.17). If the terminals of another cell can be connected to two points \(26 \, \text{cm}\) apart on the wire without altering the current in the wire, what is the emf of the cell?

    \caption{Schematic of the wire and accumulator setup.}
    \label{fig:12_17}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

Let's denote:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(L = 50 \, \text{cm}\) as the total length of the wire.
    \item \(R = 1 \, \Omega\) as the total resistance of the wire.
    \item \(r = 0.1 \, \Omega\) as the internal resistance of the accumulator.
    \item \(V = 2.2 \, \text{V}\) as the emf of the accumulator.
    \item \(l = 26 \, \text{cm}\) as the length of the wire between the two points where the cell is connected.
\end{itemize}

The resistance of the wire segment between the two points is given by:
\[
R_{\text{segment}} = \frac{l}{L} \times R = \frac{26}{50} \times 1 \, \Omega = 0.52 \, \Omega
\]

The current \(I\) flowing through the circuit is given by Ohm's law:
\[
I = \frac{V}{R + r} = \frac{2.2}{1 + 0.1} = \frac{2.2}{1.1} = 2 \, \text{A}
\]

For the current in the wire to remain unchanged when the cell is connected, the potential difference across the \(26 \, \text{cm}\) segment must equal the emf of the cell. The potential difference across this segment is:
\[
V_{\text{segment}} = I \times R_{\text{segment}} = 2 \times 0.52 = 1.04 \, \text{V}
\]

Thus, the emf of the cell is:
\[
\boxed{1.04 \, \text{V}}
\]

\section*{Problem Statement}

A galvanometer together with an unknown resistance in series is connected across two identical batteries, each of 1.5 V. When the batteries are connected in series, the galvanometer records a current of 1 A, and when the batteries are in parallel, the current is 0.6 A. What is the internal resistance of the battery? [Indian Institute of Technology 1973]

\section*{Solution}

Let \( R \) be the unknown resistance and \( r \) be the internal resistance of each battery.

\subsection*{Case 1: Batteries in Series}

When the batteries are connected in series, the total voltage is:
\[
V_{\text{series}} = 1.5\, \text{V} + 1.5\, \text{V} = 3\, \text{V}
\]

The total resistance in the circuit is \( R + 2r \). According to Ohm's Law:
\[
I_{\text{series}} = \frac{V_{\text{series}}}{R + 2r} = 1\, \text{A}
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
R + 2r = \frac{3\, \text{V}}{1\, \text{A}} = 3\, \Omega \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

\subsection*{Case 2: Batteries in Parallel}

When the batteries are connected in parallel, the total voltage remains 1.5 V. The equivalent internal resistance of the batteries is \( \frac{r}{2} \). The total resistance in the circuit is \( R + \frac{r}{2} \). According to Ohm's Law:
\[
I_{\text{parallel}} = \frac{V_{\text{parallel}}}{R + \frac{r}{2}} = 0.6\, \text{A}
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
R + \frac{r}{2} = \frac{1.5\, \text{V}}{0.6\, \text{A}} = 2.5\, \Omega \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

\subsection*{Solving the Equations}

From Equation 1:
\[
R + 2r = 3
\]

From Equation 2:
\[
R + \frac{r}{2} = 2.5
\]

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:
\[
(R + 2r) - \left(R + \frac{r}{2}\right) = 3 - 2.5
\]

Simplifying gives:
\[
2r - \frac{r}{2} = 0.5
\]

\[
\frac{4r - r}{2} = 0.5
\]

\[
\frac{3r}{2} = 0.5
\]

\[
3r = 1
\]

\[
r = \frac{1}{3} \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the internal resistance of each battery is \( \frac{1}{3} \, \Omega \).

In a potentiometer experiment, it is found that no current passes through the galvanometer when the terminals of the cell are connected across 52 cm of the potentiometer wire. If the cell is shunted by a resistance of $5\,\Omega$, a balance is found when the cell is connected across 40 cm of the wire. Find the internal resistance of the cell.

\section*{Solution}

Let $E$ be the emf of the cell and $r$ be its internal resistance. When no current passes through the galvanometer, the potential difference across the 52 cm of the wire is equal to the emf of the cell:

\[
E = k \times 52
\]

where $k$ is the potential gradient along the wire.

When the cell is shunted by a resistance of $5\,\Omega$, the balance point is at 40 cm. The potential difference across 40 cm of the wire is:

\[
V = k \times 40
\]

The current through the cell when shunted is given by:

\[
I = \frac{E}{r + 5}
\]

The potential difference across the shunt is also $V$, so:

\[
V = I \times 5 = \frac{E}{r + 5} \times 5
\]

Substituting $V = k \times 40$ and $E = k \times 52$, we get:

\[
k \times 40 = \frac{k \times 52}{r + 5} \times 5
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
40(r + 5) = 52 \times 5
\]

\[
40r + 200 = 260
\]

\[
40r = 60
\]

\[
r = \frac{60}{40} = 1.5\,\Omega
\]

Thus, the internal resistance of the cell is $1.5\,\Omega$.

\section*{Problem}

A potential difference of $220 \, \text{V}$ is maintained across a $12,000 \, \Omega$ rheostat $ab$ (see Fig. 12.20). The voltmeter $V$ has a resistance of $6000 \, \Omega$ and point $c$ is at one-fourth the distance from $a$ to $b$. What is the reading in the voltmeter? [Indian Institute of Technology 1977]

\section*{Solution}

To find the reading on the voltmeter, we need to determine the potential difference between point $c$ and point $b$. 

Given:
\begin{align*}
    V_{\text{total}} &= 220 \, \text{V}, \\
    R_{ab} &= 12,000 \, \Omega, \\
    R_V &= 6,000 \, \Omega.
\end{align*}

Point $c$ is at one-fourth the distance from $a$ to $b$, so the resistance from $a$ to $c$ is:
\[
R_{ac} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12,000 \, \Omega = 3,000 \, \Omega.
\]

The resistance from $c$ to $b$ is:
\[
R_{cb} = R_{ab} - R_{ac} = 12,000 \, \Omega - 3,000 \, \Omega = 9,000 \, \Omega.
\]

The voltmeter is connected across $cb$, and its resistance is in parallel with $R_{cb}$. The equivalent resistance $R_{\text{eq}}$ of $R_{cb}$ and $R_V$ is given by:
\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_{cb}} + \frac{1}{R_V} = \frac{1}{9,000 \, \Omega} + \frac{1}{6,000 \, \Omega}.
\]

Calculating $R_{\text{eq}}$:
\[
R_{\text{eq}} = \left(\frac{1}{9,000} + \frac{1}{6,000}\right)^{-1} \Omega = \left(\frac{2}{18,000} + \frac{3}{18,000}\right)^{-1} \Omega = \left(\frac{5}{18,000}\right)^{-1} \Omega = \frac{18,000}{5} \, \Omega = 3,600 \, \Omega.
\]

The current $I$ through the circuit is:
\[
I = \frac{V_{\text{total}}}{R_{ab}} = \frac{220 \, \text{V}}{12,000 \, \Omega} = \frac{11}{600} \, \text{A}.
\]

The potential difference across $cb$ is:
\[
V_{cb} = I \times R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{11}{600} \, \text{A} \times 3,600 \, \Omega = 66 \, \text{V}.
\]

Therefore, the reading on the voltmeter is $66 \, \text{V}$.

where \( R_1 \) is the resistance in the left-hand gap, \( R_2 = 3.5 \, \Omega \) is the resistance in the right-hand gap, \( l_1 = 30 \, \text{cm} \) is the length from the left to the balance point, and \( l_2 = 100 \, \text{cm} - l_1 = 70 \, \text{cm} \) is the length from the balance point to the right.

Substituting the known values into the equation, we have:

\[
\frac{R_1}{3.5} = \frac{30}{70}
\]

Solving for \( R_1 \):

\[
R_1 = 3.5 \times \frac{30}{70}
\]

\[
R_1 = 3.5 \times \frac{3}{7}
\]

\[
R_1 = 1.5 \, \Omega
\]

Therefore, the resistance in the left-hand gap is \( 1.5 \, \Omega \).

\section*{Problem Statement}

A pocket voltmeter has a resistance of $120 \, \Omega$. What will it read when connected to a battery with an emf of $9 \, \text{V}$ and an internal resistance of $15 \, \Omega$?

\section*{Solution}

To find the reading of the voltmeter, we need to consider the circuit formed by the battery and the voltmeter. The total resistance in the circuit is the sum of the internal resistance of the battery and the resistance of the voltmeter:

\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{internal}} + R_{\text{voltmeter}} = 15 \, \Omega + 120 \, \Omega = 135 \, \Omega
\]

The current $I$ flowing through the circuit can be calculated using Ohm's Law:

\[
I = \frac{\text{emf}}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{9 \, \text{V}}{135 \, \Omega} = \frac{1}{15} \, \text{A}
\]

The voltage across the voltmeter, which is the reading of the voltmeter, is given by:

\[
V_{\text{voltmeter}} = I \times R_{\text{voltmeter}} = \left(\frac{1}{15} \, \text{A}\right) \times 120 \, \Omega = 8 \, \text{V}

Therefore, the voltmeter will read $8 \, \text{V}$.

\section*{Problem}

When a galvanometer is shunted with a $1/\Omega_1$ resistance, only 1\% of the main current passes through it. What is the resistance of the galvanometer?

\section*{Solution}

Let \( R_g \) be the resistance of the galvanometer, and \( R_s = \frac{1}{\Omega_1} \) be the shunt resistance. According to the problem, only 1\% of the total current \( I \) passes through the galvanometer, which means 99\% of the current passes through the shunt. 

Using the current division rule, we have:
\[
\frac{I_g}{I} = \frac{R_s}{R_g + R_s}
\]
where \( I_g \) is the current through the galvanometer.

Given that \( \frac{I_g}{I} = 0.01 \), we can write:
\[
0.01 = \frac{R_s}{R_g + R_s}
\]

Substituting \( R_s = \frac{1}{\Omega_1} \), we get:
\[
0.01 = \frac{\frac{1}{\Omega_1}}{R_g + \frac{1}{\Omega_1}}
\]

Solving for \( R_g \), we multiply both sides by \( R_g + \frac{1}{\Omega_1} \):
\[
0.01 (R_g + \frac{1}{\Omega_1}) = \frac{1}{\Omega_1}
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
0.01 R_g + \frac{0.01}{\Omega_1} = \frac{1}{\Omega_1}
\]

Subtracting \( \frac{0.01}{\Omega_1} \) from both sides:
\[
0.01 R_g = \frac{1}{\Omega_1} - \frac{0.01}{\Omega_1}
\]

\[
0.01 R_g = \frac{0.99}{\Omega_1}
\]

Finally, solving for \( R_g \):
\[
R_g = \frac{0.99}{0.01 \Omega_1} = \frac{99}{\Omega_1}
\]

Thus, the resistance of the galvanometer is \( \frac{99}{\Omega_1} \).

A 10 V battery, having an internal resistance of $1.0 \, \Omega$, is joined in parallel with another battery of 20 V and internal resistance of $2 \, \Omega$. Calculate the current flowing through each battery, and the rates of expenditure of energy in the two batteries and the $30 \, \Omega$ resistance (see Fig. 12.21).

    \label{fig:12_21}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we need to apply Kirchhoff's laws and Ohm's law. Let's denote the current through the 10 V battery as $I_1$ and the current through the 20 V battery as $I_2$.

Using Kirchhoff's loop rule for the parallel circuit, we have:

\begin{align}
    10 - I_1 \cdot 1 - I \cdot 30 &= 0, \\
    20 - I_2 \cdot 2 - I \cdot 30 &= 0,
\end{align}

where $I$ is the total current through the $30 \, \Omega$ resistor.

Solving these equations will give us the values of $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I$. The rate of energy expenditure (power) in each battery and the resistor can be calculated using the formula:

\begin{equation}
    P = I^2 \cdot R,

\section*{Problem Statement}

A battery of electromotive force (emf) $E_1 = 1 \, \text{V}$ and internal resistance $r_1 = 2 \, \Omega$ is connected in parallel to another battery of emf $E_2 = 2 \, \text{V}$ and internal resistance $r_2 = 1 \, \Omega$. This combination is connected to an external resistance $R = 10 \, \Omega$. Find the currents in the circuit.

\section*{Solution}

To solve for the currents, we first need to determine the equivalent resistance of the internal resistances in parallel with the external resistance. The total resistance $R_{\text{total}}$ is given by:

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{r_2} + \frac{1}{R}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{10}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{2} + 1 + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} + \frac{10}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{16}{10}
\]

\[
R_{\text{total}} = \frac{10}{16} = \frac{5}{8} \, \Omega
\]

Next, we apply Kirchhoff's loop rule to find the current $I$ through the circuit. The total emf in the circuit is the sum of the emfs since they are in parallel:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 1 \, \text{V} + 2 \, \text{V} = 3 \, \text{V}
\]

Using Ohm's Law, the total current $I$ is:

\[
I = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{3}{\frac{5}{8}} = \frac{3 \times 8}{5} = \frac{24}{5} = 4.8 \, \text{A}
\]

Thus, the current in the circuit is $4.8 \, \text{A}$.

\section*{Problem}
The electric current of 5 A is divided into three branches, forming a parallel combination. The lengths of the wire in the three branches are in the ratio 2, 3, and 4; the diameters are in the ratio 3, 4, and 5. Find the current in each branch, if the wires are of the same material. [Indian Institute of Technology 1975]

\section*{Solution}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total current, $I = 5 \, \text{A}$
    \item Lengths ratio: $L_1 : L_2 : L_3 = 2 : 3 : 4$
    \item Diameters ratio: $d_1 : d_2 : d_3 = 3 : 4 : 5$
\end{itemize}

Since the wires are of the same material, the resistance $R$ of a wire is given by:
\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]
where $\rho$ is the resistivity, $L$ is the length, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. The area $A$ is related to the diameter $d$ by $A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$.

Thus, the resistance can be expressed as:
\[
R \propto \frac{L}{d^2}
\]

Let the resistances be $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$. Then:
\[
R_1 : R_2 : R_3 = \frac{L_1}{d_1^2} : \frac{L_2}{d_2^2} : \frac{L_3}{d_3^2} = \frac{2}{3^2} : \frac{3}{4^2} : \frac{4}{5^2}
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
R_1 = \frac{2}{9}, \quad R_2 = \frac{3}{16}, \quad R_3 = \frac{4}{25}
\]

To find the currents $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ in each branch, we use the formula for parallel resistances:
\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}
\]

The current in each branch is inversely proportional to the resistance:
\[
I_1 = \frac{I}{R_1} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}}, \quad I_2 = \frac{I}{R_2} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}}, \quad I_3 = \frac{I}{R_3} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}}
\]

Calculating the equivalent resistance:
\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{9}{2} + \frac{16}{3} + \frac{25}{4}
\]

Finding a common denominator and solving:
\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{54}{12} + \frac{64}{12} + \frac{75}{12} = \frac{193}{12}
\]

Thus, $R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{12}{193}$.

Now, calculate the currents:
\[
I_1 = 5 \times \frac{\frac{9}{2}}{\frac{193}{12}}, \quad I_2 = 5 \times \frac{\frac{16}{3}}{\frac{193}{12}}, \quad I_3 = 5 \times \frac{\frac{25}{4}}{\frac{193}{12}}

I_1 = 5 \times \frac{54}{193}, \quad I_2 = "

\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

To find the current through the $3\,\Omega$ resistor, we first calculate the total resistance in the circuit. The total resistance $R_{\text{total}}$ is the sum of the internal resistance of the battery and the resistance of the $3\,\Omega$ resistor:

\[
R_{\text{total}} = \frac{2}{3}\,\Omega + 3\,\Omega = \frac{11}{3}\,\Omega
\]

Using Ohm's Law, the current $I$ through the circuit is given by:

\[
I = \frac{V}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1.8\,\text{V}}{\frac{11}{3}\,\Omega} = \frac{1.8 \times 3}{11}\,\text{A} = \frac{5.4}{11}\,\text{A} \approx 0.491\,\text{A}
\]

Next, we calculate the power dissipated in the entire circuit. The power $P$ is given by:

\[
P = I^2 \times R_{\text{total}} = \left(\frac{5.4}{11}\right)^2 \times \frac{11}{3}\,\Omega
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
P = \frac{5.4^2}{11^2} \times \frac{11}{3} = \frac{29.16}{121} \times \frac{11}{3} = \frac{29.16 \times 11}{363} = \frac{320.76}{363} \approx 0.884\,\text{W}
\]

Thus, the current through the $3\,\Omega$ resistor is approximately $0.491\,\text{A}$, and the power dissipated in the entire circuit is approximately $0.884\,\text{W}$.

\title{Physics Problem: Series Circuit with Cells and Coils}
\author{University of London}
\date{}
\maketitle

\textbf{Problem:}

A series circuit is made up of two cells of electromotive force (emf) $1.5 \, \text{V}$ and $3 \, \text{V}$, respectively, and two coils each of resistance $10 \, \Omega$, arranged in the order: cell, coil, cell, coil. The center points of the two coils are joined by a sensitive galvanometer which shows no deflection. If the cell of $1.5 \, \text{V}$ has an internal resistance of $5 \, \Omega$, calculate the internal resistance of the other cell.

\textbf{Solution:}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Emf of first cell, $E_1 = 1.5 \, \text{V}$
    \item Internal resistance of first cell, $r_1 = 5 \, \Omega$
    \item Emf of second cell, $E_2 = 3 \, \text{V}$
    \item Resistance of each coil, $R = 10 \, \Omega$
\end{itemize}

Since the galvanometer shows no deflection, the potential difference across both coils must be equal. Therefore, the potential drop across the first coil due to the first cell must equal the potential drop across the second coil due to the second cell.

For the first cell and coil:
\[
V_1 = \frac{E_1}{R + r_1} \times R
\]

For the second cell and coil:
\[
V_2 = \frac{E_2}{R + r_2} \times R
\]

Setting $V_1 = V_2$, we have:
\[
\frac{E_1}{R + r_1} \times R = \frac{E_2}{R + r_2} \times R
\]

Canceling $R$ from both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{E_1}{R + r_1} = \frac{E_2}{R + r_2}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{1.5}{10 + 5} = \frac{3}{10 + r_2}
\]

Solving for $r_2$:
\[
\frac{1.5}{15} = \frac{3}{10 + r_2}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
1.5 \times (10 + r_2) = 3 \times 15
\]

\[
15 + 1.5r_2 = 45
\]

\[
1.5r_2 = 45 - 15
\]

\[
1.5r_2 = 30
\]

\[
r_2 = \frac{30}{1.5}
\]

\[
r_2 = 20 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the internal resistance of the second cell is $20 \, \Omega$.

A battery with electromotive force (emf) $\mathcal{E} = 24 \, \text{V}$ has an internal resistance $r = 0.02 \, \Omega$. A load resistor $R = 140 \, \Omega$ is connected to the terminals of the battery. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] \textbf{Find the current flowing in the circuit under load conditions.}

    The total resistance in the circuit is the sum of the internal resistance and the load resistance:
    \[
    R_{\text{total}} = r + R = 0.02 \, \Omega + 140 \, \Omega = 140.02 \, \Omega

    \item[(ii)] \textbf{Find the terminal voltage of the battery under load conditions.}

    The terminal voltage $V_{\text{terminal}}$ is given by:
    \[
    V_{\text{terminal}} = \mathcal{E} - I \cdot r = 24 \, \text{V} - (0.1714 \, \text{A} \times 0.02 \, \Omega) \approx 23.9966 \, \text{V}
    \]

    \item[(iii)] \textbf{Find the power dissipated in the resistor $R$ and in the battery's internal resistance $r$.}

    The power dissipated in the load resistor $R$ is:
    \[
    P_R = I^2 \cdot R = (0.1714 \, \text{A})^2 \times 140 \, \Omega \approx 4.114 \, \text{W}
    \]

    The power dissipated in the internal resistance $r$ is:
    \[
    P_r = I^2 \cdot r = (0.1714 \, \text{A})^2 \times 0.02 \, \Omega \approx 0.000588 \, \text{W}
    \]

    \item[(iv)] \textbf{Find the open circuit voltage of the battery under no load conditions and explain your answer.}

    The open circuit voltage of the battery is equal to the emf of the battery, as there is no current flowing through the internal resistance. Therefore, the open circuit voltage is:
    \[
    V_{\text{open}} = \mathcal{E} = 24 \, \text{V}
    \]

    This is because, under no load conditions, the internal resistance does not drop any voltage since the current is zero.

To apply Kirchhoff's rules to the circuit shown in Fig. 12.25, we will derive three equations for the three unknown branch currents, \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\).

\subsection*{Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)}

At a junction, the sum of currents entering the junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction. Assuming a junction where currents \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\) meet, we have:
\[
I_1 = I_2 + I_3
\]

\subsection*{Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)}

For a closed loop in the circuit, the sum of the electromotive forces (emf) is equal to the sum of the potential drops (voltage drops). Assuming two loops in the circuit, we can write:

\paragraph{Loop 1:}
\[
E_1 - R_1 I_1 - R_2 I_2 = 0
\]

\paragraph{Loop 2:}
\[
E_2 - R_3 I_3 - R_2 I_2 = 0
\]

\subsection*{Summary of Equations}

The three equations derived from Kirchhoff's rules are:
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad I_1 = I_2 + I_3 \\
2. & \quad E_1 - R_1 I_1 - R_2 I_2 = 0 \\
3. & \quad E_2 - R_3 I_3 - R_2 I_2 = 0
\end{align*}

These equations can be solved to find the values of the branch currents \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\).

\section*{Kirchhoff's Rules}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):} The sum of currents entering a junction equals the sum of currents leaving the junction. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
    \[
    \sum I_{\text{in}} = \sum I_{\text{out}}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):} The sum of the electromotive forces (emfs) and potential differences (voltage drops) around any closed loop in a circuit is zero. This can be written as:
    \[
    \sum \mathcal{E} - \sum IR = 0
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Application of Kirchhoff's Rules}

Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 12.26. We apply Kirchhoff's rules to obtain the following three equations for the unknown branch currents \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Applying KCL at junction \(A\):
    \[
    I_1 = I_2 + I_3
    \]

    \item Applying KVL to loop 1 (assuming clockwise direction):
    \[
    \mathcal{E}_1 - I_1 R_1 - I_2 R_2 = 0
    \]

    \item Applying KVL to loop 2 (assuming clockwise direction):
    \[
    \mathcal{E}_2 - I_3 R_3 - I_2 R_2 = 0
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem Statement}

Figure 12.27 shows a series-parallel resistive circuit connected to a DC supply. For the circuit shown, work out the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$ across resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$.
    \item The voltage $V_p$ across resistors $R_3$ and $R_4$.
    \item The currents $I_T$, $I_2$, and $I_3$.

    \label{fig:12_27}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we will apply Ohm's Law and the rules for series and parallel circuits.

\subsection*{(i) Voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$}

Assuming the total voltage supplied by the DC source is $V_S$, the voltage across $R_1$ and $R_2$ can be calculated using the voltage division rule:

\[
V_1 = \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot V_S
\]

\[
V_2 = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot V_S
\]

\subsection*{(ii) Voltage $V_p$}

Resistors $R_3$ and $R_4$ are in parallel, so the voltage across them is the same:

\[
V_p = V_1
\]

\subsection*{(iii) Currents $I_T$, $I_2$, and $I_3$}

The total current $I_T$ supplied by the source is:

\[
I_T = \frac{V_S}{R_{\text{total}}}
\]

where $R_{\text{total}}$ is the equivalent resistance of the circuit.

The current $I_2$ through $R_2$ is:

\[
I_2 = \frac{V_2}{R_2}
\]

The current $I_3$ through $R_3$ and $R_4$ (in parallel) is:

\[
I_3 = \frac{V_p}{R_3} = \frac{V_p}{R_4}
\]

\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

Apply Kirchhoff’s rules to the circuit shown in Fig. 12.28 to produce three equations with three unknown branch currents. You do not have to solve these equations for individual currents \(I\).

\section*{Solution}

Assume a circuit with three loops and three branch currents \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\). According to Kirchhoff's rules, we have:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):} At any junction, the sum of currents entering the junction equals the sum of currents leaving the junction.
    \item \textbf{Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):} The sum of the electromotive forces (emf) and potential differences (voltage drops) in any closed loop is zero.
\end{itemize}

Assuming the circuit has the following components and voltages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(R_1, R_2, R_3\) are the resistances in the circuit.
    \item \(E_1, E_2\) are the electromotive forces (batteries) in the circuit.
\end{itemize}

The equations based on Kirchhoff's rules are:

\begin{align}
    \text{Loop 1:} \quad & E_1 - I_1 R_1 - I_2 R_2 = 0, \\
    \text{Loop 2:} \quad & I_2 R_2 - I_3 R_3 - E_2 = 0, \\
    \text{Junction:} \quad & I_1 = I_2 + I_3.
\end{align}

These equations represent the application of Kirchhoff's rules to the circuit in Fig. 12.28. The unknowns \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\) can be solved using these equations.

\section*{Applying Kirchhoff's Rules}

To analyze the circuit shown in Fig. 12.29 using Kirchhoff's rules, we write down the equations for the loops and junctions. Assume the circuit has three branches with currents \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\). The resistances in the branches are \(R_1\), \(R_2\), and \(R_3\), and the electromotive forces (emf) are \(E_1\) and \(E_2\).

\subsection*{Junction Rule}
At a junction, the sum of currents entering the junction equals the sum of currents leaving the junction. Assuming the currents \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\) meet at a junction, we have:
\[
I_1 = I_2 + I_3
\]

\subsection*{Loop Rules}
For Loop 1, which includes \(E_1\), \(R_1\), and \(R_2\):
\[
E_1 - I_1 R_1 - I_2 R_2 = 0
\]

For Loop 2, which includes \(E_2\), \(R_2\), and \(R_3\):
\[
E_2 - I_2 R_2 - I_3 R_3 = 0
\]

For Loop 3, which includes \(E_1\), \(E_2\), \(R_1\), and \(R_3\):
\[
E_1 - E_2 - I_1 R_1 + I_3 R_3 = 0
\]

These equations can be solved simultaneously to find the values of the currents \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\).

\title{Physics Problem: Circuit Analysis}
\author{Indian Institute of Technology 1973}
\date{}
\maketitle

In the circuit shown in Fig. 12.30, the cells $E_1$ and $E_2$ have electromotive forces (emfs) of 4 V and 8 V, and internal resistances of 0.5 $\Omega$ and 1 $\Omega$, respectively. Calculate the current in each resistor and the potential difference across each cell.

\section{Resistance, EMF, Current, Power}

\subsection{Resistance Calculation}

In the segment ACD, the two 3 $\Omega$ resistances give a total resistance of 6 $\Omega$, which in parallel with another 6 $\Omega$ yields:
\[
R_{\text{parallel}} = \frac{6 \times 6}{6 + 6} = 3 \, \Omega.
\]
This, together with a 3 $\Omega$ resistance across DE in series, gives a total of:
\[
R_{\text{series}} = 6 \, \Omega.
\]
Which, together with another 6 $\Omega$ across AE in parallel, gives:
\[
R_{\text{parallel}} = \frac{6 \times 6}{6 + 6} = 3 \, \Omega.
\]
By similar reasoning, the resistance along AFB is 6 $\Omega$, which with a 3 $\Omega$ across AB in parallel yields the effective resistance across AB:
\[
R_{AB} = \frac{6 \times 3}{6 + 3} = 2 \, \Omega.
\]

\subsection{Change in Resistance}

The resistance $R$ is given by:
\[
R = \frac{\rho l}{A} = \frac{\rho l^2}{A l} = \frac{\rho l^2}{v_0}
\]
where $v_0$ is the constant volume. The change in the resistance $\Delta R$ is:
\[
\Delta R = \frac{2 \rho l \Delta l}{v_0}
\]
Thus, the relative change in resistance is:
\[
\frac{\Delta R}{R} = \frac{2 \Delta l}{l} = \frac{2 \times 0.1}{100} = 0.2\% 
\]
