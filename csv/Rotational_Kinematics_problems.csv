\section*{Physics Problem: Loop-the-loop}

A particle starts at height \( h \) on the slide and acquires a velocity \( v \) at the bottom of the loop. The behavior of the particle depends on the velocity \( v \) as follows:

- If \( v < \sqrt{2gR} \), the particle will not be able to climb beyond the point \( B \). It will oscillate in the lower semicircle about the point \( D \).
- If \( \sqrt{2gR} < v < \sqrt{5gR} \), the particle will be able to climb up the arc \( BC \) and leave at some point \( E \) and describe a parabolic path.
- If \( v > \sqrt{5gR} \), the particle will be able to execute a complete circle. This corresponds to a height \( h = 2.5R \).

A particle is moving in a plane with constant radial velocity of magnitude \(\dot{r} = 5 \, \text{m/s}\) and a constant angular velocity of magnitude \(\dot{\theta} = 4 \, \text{rad/s}\). Determine the magnitude of the velocity when the particle is 3 m from the origin.

To find the magnitude of the velocity \(v\) of the particle, we use the formula for velocity in polar coordinates:
\[
v = \sqrt{\dot{r}^2 + (r\dot{\theta})^2}
\]

Given:
\[
\dot{r} = 5 \, \text{m/s}, \quad \dot{\theta} = 4 \, \text{rad/s}, \quad r = 3 \, \text{m}
\]

Substitute the given values into the equation:
\[
v = \sqrt{(5 \, \text{m/s})^2 + (3 \, \text{m} \times 4 \, \text{rad/s})^2}
\]

Calculate:
\[
v = \sqrt{25 + (12)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 144} = \sqrt{169} = 13 \, \text{m/s}

3.4,"To solve this problem, we need to find the time at which the normal (centripetal) acceleration equals the tangential acceleration. Let's denote:

- \( a_t = 10 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \) as the tangential acceleration,
- \( r = 40 \, \text{cm} \) as the radius of the circle.

The normal acceleration \( a_n \) is given by:

\[
a_n = \frac{v^2}{r}
\]

where \( v \) is the tangential velocity. Since the point starts from rest and moves with a constant tangential acceleration, the velocity \( v \) at time \( t \) is:

\[
v = a_t \cdot t
\]

Substituting this into the expression for normal acceleration, we get:

\[
a_n = \frac{(a_t \cdot t)^2}{r}
\]

We set the normal acceleration equal to the tangential acceleration:

\[
\frac{(a_t \cdot t)^2}{r} = a_t
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
(a_t \cdot t)^2 = a_t \cdot r
\]

\[
a_t^2 \cdot t^2 = a_t \cdot r
\]

Dividing both sides by \( a_t \) (assuming \( a_t \neq 0 \)):

\[
a_t \cdot t^2 = r
\]

Solving for \( t^2 \):

\[
t^2 = \frac{r}{a_t}
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
t = \sqrt{\frac{r}{a_t}}
\]

Substituting the given values \( r = 40 \, \text{cm} \) and \( a_t = 10 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \):

\[
t = \sqrt{\frac{40}{10}} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \, \text{s}

Thus, the time needed for the normal acceleration to equal the tangential acceleration is \( \boxed{2 \, \text{s}} \)."
3.5,"To solve this problem, we need to find the normal and tangential accelerations of a point moving along a circular path. Let's format this into LaTeX:

```latex
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

A point moves along a circle of radius \( R = 4 \, \text{cm} \). The distance \( x \) is related to time \( t \) by the equation:
\[
x = c t^3
\]
where \( c = 0.3 \, \text{cm/s}^3 \). We need to find the normal and tangential accelerations of the point at the instant when its linear velocity is \( v = 0.4 \, \text{m/s} \).

First, let's find the expression for the velocity \( v \):
\[
v = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(c t^3) = 3c t^2
\]

Given \( v = 0.4 \, \text{m/s} = 40 \, \text{cm/s} \), we can solve for \( t \):
\[
40 = 3 \times 0.3 \times t^2 \implies t^2 = \frac{40}{0.9} \implies t = \sqrt{\frac{40}{0.9}}
\]

Next, we find the tangential acceleration \( a_t \):
\[
a_t = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(3c t^2) = 6c t
\]

Substituting the value of \( t \) we found:
\[
a_t = 6 \times 0.3 \times \sqrt{\frac{40}{0.9}}
\]

Now, let's find the normal acceleration \( a_n \):
\[
a_n = \frac{v^2}{R}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
a_n = \frac{(40)^2}{4}
\]

Thus, the normal and tangential accelerations are:
\[
a_t = 6 \times 0.3 \times \sqrt{\frac{40}{0.9}} \, \text{cm/s}^2
\]
\[
a_n = \frac{1600}{4} = 400 \, \text{cm/s}^2

\title{Conical Pendulum Problem}

\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

The conical pendulum consists of a bob of mass $m$ attached to the end of an inflexible light string tied to a fixed point $O$ and swung around so that it describes a circle in a horizontal plane. While revolving, the string generates a conical surface around the vertical axis $ON$, the height of the cone being $ON = H$, the projection of $OP$ on the vertical axis (see Fig. 3.2). Show that the angular velocity of the bob is given by $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{H}}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

    \caption{Conical pendulum}
    \label{fig:conical_pendulum}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

To derive the expression for the angular velocity $\omega$, consider the forces acting on the bob. The tension $T$ in the string provides the necessary centripetal force for circular motion and also balances the gravitational force. Let $\theta$ be the angle between the string and the vertical axis.

The vertical component of the tension balances the weight of the bob:
\[
T \cos \theta = mg
\]

The horizontal component provides the centripetal force:
\[
T \sin \theta = m \omega^2 r
\]

where $r$ is the radius of the circular path, given by $r = L \sin \theta$, with $L$ being the length of the string.

From the geometry of the conical pendulum, we have:
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{H}{L}
\]

Substituting $r = L \sin \theta$ into the centripetal force equation and using $\cos \theta = \frac{H}{L}$, we get:
\[
T \sin \theta = m \omega^2 L \sin \theta
\]

Using the vertical force balance equation, we can express $T$ as:
\[
T = \frac{mg}{\cos \theta}
\]

Substitute $T$ into the centripetal force equation:
\[
\frac{mg \sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = m \omega^2 L \sin \theta
\]

Cancel $m \sin \theta$ from both sides:
\[
\frac{g}{\cos \theta} = \omega^2 L
\]

Substitute $\cos \theta = \frac{H}{L}$:
\[
\frac{g}{\frac{H}{L}} = \omega^2 L
\]

Simplify to find $\omega$:
\[
g \frac{L}{H} = \omega^2 L
\]

\[
\omega^2 = \frac{g}{H}
\]

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{H}}
\]

Thus, the angular velocity of the bob is $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{H}}$.

3.11,"To solve this problem, we need to consider the physics of a conical pendulum. A conical pendulum consists of a mass (bob) attached to a string, which moves in a horizontal circle while the string traces out a cone. The height difference of the bob when the angular velocity changes can be calculated using the relationship between the centripetal force and the gravitational force.

Here is the LaTeX code for the problem and its solution:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\section*{Problem}

If the number of steady revolutions per minute of a conical pendulum is increased from 70 to 80, what would be the difference in the level of the bob?

\section*{Solution}

To find the difference in the level of the bob, we need to consider the geometry and dynamics of a conical pendulum. The bob of the pendulum moves in a horizontal circle with radius \( r \), and the string makes an angle \( \theta \) with the vertical. The forces acting on the bob are the tension in the string \( T \) and the gravitational force \( mg \).

The centripetal force required to keep the bob moving in a circle is provided by the horizontal component of the tension:

\[
T \sin \theta = m \omega^2 r
\]

where \( \omega \) is the angular velocity in radians per second. The vertical component of the tension balances the gravitational force:

\[
T \cos \theta = mg
\]

Dividing these two equations gives:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\omega^2 r}{g}
\]

The height \( h \) of the bob above the lowest point is given by:

\[
h = L \cos \theta
\]

where \( L \) is the length of the string. Using the relation for \(\cos \theta\):

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{g}{\sqrt{g^2 + \omega^4 r^2}}
\]

The angular velocity \( \omega \) is related to the revolutions per minute (rpm) by:

\[
\omega = \frac{2 \pi N}{60}
\]

where \( N \) is the number of revolutions per minute.

Now, calculate the height difference when \( N \) changes from 70 to 80 rpm.

Let \( h_1 \) and \( h_2 \) be the heights for 70 rpm and 80 rpm, respectively.

\[
h_1 = L \frac{g}{\sqrt{g^2 + \left(\frac{2 \pi \times 70}{60}\right)^4 r^2}}
\]

\[
h_2 = L \frac{g}{\sqrt{g^2 + \left(\frac{2 \pi \times 80}{60}\right)^4 r^2}}
\]

The difference in height \(\Delta h\) is:

\[
\Delta h = h_2 - h_1
\]

Substitute the values and solve for \(\Delta h\) to find the difference in the level of the bob.

\section*{Problem}

A particle of mass $m$ is attached to a spring of initial length $L_0$ and spring constant $k$. It is rotated in a horizontal plane with an angular velocity $\omega$. What is the new length of the spring and the tension in the spring?

\section*{Solution}

To find the new length of the spring and the tension in the spring, we start by considering the forces acting on the particle. The centripetal force required to keep the particle moving in a circle is provided by the tension $T$ in the spring. The centripetal force is given by:

\begin{equation}
F_{\text{centripetal}} = m \omega^2 L,
\end{equation}

where $L$ is the new length of the spring.

The tension in the spring is also given by Hooke's Law:

\begin{equation}
T = k (L - L_0).
\end{equation}

Since the tension provides the centripetal force, we equate the two expressions:

\begin{equation}
k (L - L_0) = m \omega^2 L.
\end{equation}

Solving for $L$, we rearrange the equation:

\begin{equation}
kL - kL_0 = m \omega^2 L,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(k - m \omega^2)L = kL_0,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
L = \frac{kL_0}{k - m \omega^2}.
\end{equation}

This is the new length of the spring.

Substituting $L$ back into the equation for tension, we have:

\begin{equation}
T = k \left(\frac{kL_0}{k - m \omega^2} - L_0\right),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
T = \frac{k^2 L_0 - k L_0 (k - m \omega^2)}{k - m \omega^2},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
T = \frac{k m \omega^2 L_0}{k - m \omega^2}.
\end{equation}

Thus, the tension in the spring is given by this expression.

\section*{Problem}

A hollow cylinder drum of radius $r$ is placed with its axis vertical. It is rotated about an axis passing through its center and perpendicular to the face, and a coin is placed on the inside surface of the drum. If the coefficient of friction is $\mu$, what is the frequency of rotation so that the coin does not fall down?

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we need to consider the forces acting on the coin. The coin will experience a normal force $N$, a gravitational force $mg$, and a frictional force $f$.

The frictional force $f$ provides the necessary centripetal force to keep the coin from falling. Therefore, we have:

\[
f = \mu N = m \omega^2 r
\]

where $\omega$ is the angular velocity of the drum.

The gravitational force acting on the coin is:

\[
mg
\]

For the coin not to fall, the frictional force must be equal to or greater than the gravitational force:

\[
\mu N \geq mg
\]

Since $N = m \omega^2 r$, we substitute to get:

\[
\mu m \omega^2 r \geq mg
\]

Canceling $m$ from both sides (assuming $m \neq 0$), we have:

\[
\mu \omega^2 r \geq g
\]

Solving for $\omega$, we get:

\[
\omega \geq \sqrt{\frac{g}{\mu r}}
\]

The frequency of rotation $f$ is related to the angular velocity $\omega$ by:

\[
f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}
\]

Thus, the minimum frequency $f$ required is:

\[
f \geq \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{g}{\mu r}}

    &\text{Figure 3.4: Diagram illustrating the setup.} \\
    &\text{Angles: } \angle ACB = 60^\circ, \quad \angle ABC = 30^\circ.
\end{align*}

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we consider the forces acting on the ring as it rotates. The centripetal force required to keep the ring moving in a circle of radius $r$ is provided by the gravitational force component along the wire. 

The centripetal force $F_c$ is given by:
\[
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\]

where $m$ is the mass of the ring and $v$ is the speed of rotation.

The gravitational force component along the wire can be expressed as:
\[
F_g = mg \sin \theta
\]

where $\theta$ is the angle between the wire and the vertical. For the wire to maintain its form, the centripetal force must equal the gravitational force component:
\[
\frac{mv^2}{r} = mg \sin \theta
\]

Solving for $v$, we get:
\[
v^2 = rg \sin \theta
\]

Given that $\theta = 30^\circ$, we have $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:
\[
v^2 = rg \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the speed of rotation $v$ is:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{rg}{2}}
\]

However, for the wire to maintain its form, the speed should be $\sqrt{gr}$, which implies that the angle or setup might need to be adjusted to satisfy this condition.

An object is being weighed on a spring balance going around a curve of radius \( R = 100 \, \text{m} \) at a speed of \( v = 7 \, \text{m/s} \). The object has a weight of \( 50 \, \text{kg wt} \). What reading is registered on the spring balance?

\section*{Solution}

First, we convert the weight of the object from kilograms weight to newtons. The weight given is \( 50 \, \text{kg wt} \), which is equivalent to a mass of \( m = 50 \, \text{kg} \). The gravitational force (weight) is given by:

\[
W = mg = 50 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 490 \, \text{N}
\]

When the object is moving in a circular path, it experiences a centripetal force given by:

\[
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{R}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
F_c = \frac{50 \, \text{kg} \times (7 \, \text{m/s})^2}{100 \, \text{m}} = \frac{50 \times 49}{100} = 24.5 \, \text{N}
\]

The reading on the spring balance is the apparent weight, which is the vector sum of the gravitational force and the centripetal force. Since the centripetal force acts horizontally and the gravitational force acts vertically, the apparent weight \( W' \) is given by:

\[
W' = \sqrt{W^2 + F_c^2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
W' = \sqrt{(490 \, \text{N})^2 + (24.5 \, \text{N})^2}
\]

\[
W' = \sqrt{240100 + 600.25} = \sqrt{240700.25}
\]

\[
W' \approx 490.6 \, \text{N}
\]

Thus, the reading registered on the spring balance is approximately \( 490.6 \, \text{N} \).

\section*{Problem}

An early railway carriage has its center of gravity at a height of 1 m above the rails, which are 1.5 m apart. Find the maximum safe speed at which it could travel around the unbanked curve of radius 100 m.

\section*{Solution}

To find the maximum safe speed, we need to consider the condition for tipping over. The carriage will tip over if the centripetal force causes the center of gravity to move outside the base of support, which is the distance between the rails.

The centripetal force \( F_c \) required to keep the carriage moving in a circle is given by:

\[
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the carriage, \( v \) is the velocity, and \( r \) is the radius of the curve.

The tipping condition occurs when the moment due to the centripetal force about the outer rail equals the moment due to the gravitational force. This can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{mv^2}{r} \cdot \frac{1.5}{2} = mg \cdot 1
\]

where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[
\frac{v^2}{r} \cdot \frac{1.5}{2} = g
\]

Solving for \( v \), we have:

\[
v^2 = \frac{2rg}{1.5}
\]

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2rg}{1.5}}
\]

Substituting the given values \( r = 100 \, \text{m} \) and \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), we find:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 100 \times 9.81}{1.5}}
\]

\[
v \approx \sqrt{\frac{1962}{1.5}}
\]

\[
v \approx \sqrt{1308}
\]

\[
v \approx 36.17 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the maximum safe speed at which the carriage can travel around the curve is approximately \( 36.17 \, \text{m/s} \).

where:
- \(\omega\) is the angular velocity of the Earth,
- \(r\) is the radius of the circular path at the given latitude.

The angular velocity \(\omega\) of the Earth is given by:

\[
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}

\[
v = \frac{\pi \cdot 6371 \times 10^3}{86400}

\section*{Problem}

With what speed must an airplane on the equator fly towards the west so that a passenger in the plane may see the sun as motionless?

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we need to consider the rotational speed of the Earth at the equator. The Earth completes one full rotation (360 degrees) in 24 hours. The circumference of the Earth at the equator can be calculated using the formula:

\[
C = 2 \pi R
\]

where \( R \) is the radius of the Earth. The average radius of the Earth is approximately \SI{6371}{\kilo\meter}. Thus, the circumference is:

\[
C = 2 \pi \times \SI{6371}{\kilo\meter} \approx \SI{40030}{\kilo\meter}
\]

The rotational speed \( v_{\text{earth}} \) of the Earth at the equator is given by:

\[
v_{\text{earth}} = \frac{C}{T}
\]

where \( T = 24 \times 60 \times 60 = 86400 \) seconds is the period of rotation (one day). Substituting the values, we have:

\[
v_{\text{earth}} = \frac{\SI{40030}{\kilo\meter}}{86400 \, \text{seconds}} \approx \SI{463.8}{\meter\per\second}
\]

To make the sun appear motionless to a passenger on the airplane, the airplane must fly westward at the same speed as the Earth's rotational speed at the equator. Therefore, the speed of the airplane \( v_{\text{plane}} \) must be:

\[
v_{\text{plane}} = v_{\text{earth}} \approx \SI{463.8}{\meter\per\second}
\]

Thus, the airplane must fly at approximately \SI{463.8}{\meter\per\second} towards the west.

\section*{Problem}

The bob of a pendulum of mass $m$ and length $L$ is displaced $90^\circ$ from the vertical and gently released. What should be the minimum strength of the string in order that it may not break upon passing through the lowest point?

\section*{Solution}

When the pendulum bob is released from a height, it gains kinetic energy as it descends. At the lowest point, the tension in the string must be sufficient to provide the necessary centripetal force to keep the bob moving in a circular path. 

Let's analyze the forces acting on the bob at the lowest point:

1. The gravitational force acting downward: $F_g = mg$.
2. The tension in the string: $T$.

At the lowest point, the net force towards the center of the circular path is the centripetal force, which is provided by the tension minus the gravitational force:

\[
T - mg = \frac{mv^2}{L}
\]

where $v$ is the speed of the bob at the lowest point.

Using conservation of energy, the potential energy at the top is converted into kinetic energy at the bottom:

\[
mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

where $h = L$ is the height from which the bob is released. Therefore, we have:

\[
mgL = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

Solving for $v^2$, we get:

\[
v^2 = 2gL
\]

Substitute $v^2$ back into the centripetal force equation:

\[
T - mg = \frac{m(2gL)}{L}
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
T - mg = 2mg
\]

Thus, the tension in the string is:

\[
T = 3mg
\]

Therefore, the minimum strength of the string should be $3mg$ to ensure it does not break when the bob passes through the lowest point.

\section*{Problem}

The bob of a simple pendulum of length $L$ is deflected through a small arc from the equilibrium position and released. Show that when it passes through the equilibrium position its velocity will be $v = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we start by considering the energy conservation principle for the simple pendulum. The total mechanical energy at the highest point (where the bob is released) is equal to the total mechanical energy at the lowest point (equilibrium position).

At the highest point, the pendulum has potential energy and no kinetic energy. At the equilibrium position, the pendulum has kinetic energy and no potential energy. 

The potential energy at the highest point is given by:
\[
U = mgh
\]
where $h$ is the height of the bob above the equilibrium position, $m$ is the mass of the bob, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The kinetic energy at the equilibrium position is given by:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

By conservation of energy, we have:
\[
mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

Solving for $v$, we get:
\[
v^2 = 2gh
\]

For small angles, the height $h$ can be approximated using the arc length $s$ and the length of the pendulum $L$. The arc length is related to the angle $\theta$ by $s = L\theta$, and for small angles, $h \approx \frac{1}{2}L\theta^2$. Therefore, $h \approx \frac{s^2}{2L}$.

Substituting $h \approx \frac{s^2}{2L}$ into the energy equation, we have:
\[
v^2 = 2g\left(\frac{s^2}{2L}\right)
\]

Simplifying, we find:
\[
v^2 = \frac{gs^2}{L}
\]

Since $s = L\theta$ and for small angles $\theta \approx \sin\theta$, we have:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}} \cdot L\theta
\]

For small angles, $\theta$ is very small, and thus $v \approx \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$ when the pendulum passes through the equilibrium position.

Therefore, the velocity of the pendulum bob as it passes through the equilibrium position is:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}
\]

\section*{Problem}

The bob of a simple pendulum of length 1.0 m has a velocity of 6 m/s when it is at the lowest point. At what height above the center of the vertical circle will the bob leave the path?

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we will use the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. At the lowest point, the bob has maximum kinetic energy and zero potential energy. As it rises, kinetic energy is converted into potential energy.

The total mechanical energy at the lowest point is given by:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]
where \( m \) is the mass of the bob and \( v = 6 \, \text{m/s} \) is the velocity at the lowest point.

At the point where the bob leaves the path, all the kinetic energy will have been converted into potential energy. The potential energy at height \( h \) is given by:
\[
E_{\text{potential}} = mgh
\]
where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

Setting the total mechanical energy equal to the potential energy at height \( h \), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = mgh
\]

Solving for \( h \), we get:
\[
h = \frac{v^2}{2g}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
h = \frac{(6 \, \text{m/s})^2}{2 \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2} = \frac{36}{19.6} \approx 1.84 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the bob will leave the path at a height of approximately \( 1.84 \, \text{m} \) above the center of the vertical circle.

\section*{Problem Statement}

A particle slides down an incline from rest and enters a loop-the-loop. If the particle starts from a point that is level with the highest point on the circular track, find the point where the particle leaves the circular groove above the lowest point.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we will use the principles of energy conservation and circular motion.

\subsection*{Energy Conservation}

Assume the particle starts from a height $h = 2R$, where $R$ is the radius of the loop. The potential energy at the starting point is converted into kinetic energy and potential energy at any point on the loop.

The initial potential energy is:
\[
PE_{\text{initial}} = mgh = mg(2R)
\]

At any point on the loop at height $h'$, the potential energy is:
\[
PE = mgh'
\]

The kinetic energy at that point is:
\[
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

Using energy conservation:
\[
mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh'
\]

\[
2gR = \frac{1}{2}v^2 + gh'
\]

\subsection*{Circular Motion}

For the particle to stay in contact with the loop, the centripetal force must be provided by the gravitational force and the normal force. At the point where the particle leaves the loop, the normal force becomes zero. Thus, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force:
\[
mg = \frac{mv^2}{R}
\]

Solving for $v^2$, we get:
\[
v^2 = gR
\]

Substitute $v^2 = gR$ into the energy conservation equation:
\[
2gR = \frac{1}{2}(gR) + gh'
\]

\[
2gR = \frac{1}{2}gR + gh'
\]

\[
2gR - \frac{1}{2}gR = gh'
\]

\[
\frac{3}{2}gR = gh'
\]

\[
h' = \frac{3}{2}R
\]

Thus, the particle leaves the circular groove at a height of $\frac{3}{2}R$ above the lowest point.

A block is allowed to slide down a frictionless track freely under gravity. The track ends in a circular loop of radius $R$. Show that the minimum height from which the block must start is $2.5R$ so that it completes the circular track.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we need to consider the energy conservation and the condition for the block to complete the loop.

1. **Energy Conservation:**

   At the top of the loop, the block must have enough kinetic energy to maintain contact with the track. The total mechanical energy at the starting height $h$ is given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = mgh
   \]
   where $m$ is the mass of the block, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the initial height.

   At the top of the loop, the block has potential energy $mg(2R)$ and kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Thus, the total energy at the top of the loop is:
   \[
   E_{\text{top}} = mg(2R) + \frac{1}{2}mv^2
   \]

   By conservation of energy, $E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{top}}$, so:
   \[
   mgh = mg(2R) + \frac{1}{2}mv^2
   \]

2. **Condition for Completing the Loop:**

   At the top of the loop, the block must have a minimum speed $v$ such that the centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force. This condition is:
   \[
   \frac{mv^2}{R} = mg
   \]

   Solving for $v^2$, we get:
   \[
   v^2 = gR
   \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**

   Substitute $v^2 = gR$ into the energy equation:
   \[
   mgh = mg(2R) + \frac{1}{2}m(gR)
   \]

   Simplifying, we find:
   \[
   h = 2R + \frac{1}{2}R = 2.5R
   \]

Thus, the minimum height from which the block must start is $2.5R$ to complete the circular track.

- Mass of the cork, \( m_2 = 1 \, \text{g} = 0.001 \, \text{kg} \)

\subsection*{3.1}

The parametric equations for a circular path are given by:

    x &= a \cos t \quad \text{(1)} \\
    y &= a \sin t \quad \text{(2)} \\
    z &= t \quad \text{(3)}

\begin{align*}
    x^2 + y^2 &= a^2 (\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t) = a^2
\end{align*}
which is the equation of a circle. Since \( z = t \), the circular path drifts along the \( z \)-axis so that the path is a helix.
