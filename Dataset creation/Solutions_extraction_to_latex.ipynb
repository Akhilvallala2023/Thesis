Under the electric ﬁeld in they-direction the energy picked up will be qVy d =1 2mv2 =1 2m ( v2x +v2y ) or v2y =2qVy md −ω2y2 (13) where we have used (12). 13.20Referring toFig. 13.21and settingθ =ωt andR=γ/ωand (10) and (11) ofprob.(13.19)w eg e tt h ep a r a m e t r i ce q u a t i o n so fc y c l o i d y =R(1−cosθ) (1) x =R(θ−sinθ) (2) These equations deﬁne the path generated by a point on the circumference of ac i r c l ew h i c hr o l l sa l o n gt h ex-axis.

Also E= V d (4) Using (4) in (3) d2 =2mV eB2 (5) Thus the condition that the electrons are able to arrive at the positive plate is d2 <2mV eB2 13.21B= µ0i 2πr ∴ i =2πBr µ0 =2π×10−6 ×0.4 4π×10−7 =2A 13.22(a) Consider a typical current element dx.T h em a g n i t u d eo ft h ec o n t r i b u - tion dBof this element to the magnetic ﬁeld atP is found from Biot– Savart law and is given by (Fig.13.22) Fig. 13.22Magnetic induction due to a current-carrying wire of ﬁnite length dB=µ0idx sinθ 4πR2 (1) Since the direction of the contribution dBat point for all such elements is identical, i.e. at right angles to the plane of paper, the resultant ﬁeld is obtained by integrating dBfromAtoDin (1). Writing sinθ = r R B= ∫ dB=µ0ir 4π ⎡ ⎣ b∫ −a dx (x2 +r2)3/2 ⎤ ⎦= µ0ir 4πr2 x (x2 +r2)1/2 b |−a ∴ B= µ0i 4πr (cosθ1 +cosθ2) (2) (b)For inﬁnite wireθ1 →0a n dθ2 →0, in this limit (2) becomes B= µ0i 2πr which is the expression for a long wire. 13.23B=µ0i 2r ∴ i =2Br µ0 =2×10−5 ×0.5 4π×10−7 =7.96 A 13.24Magnetic ﬁeldB1 due to currenti in one segment is (Fig.13.23) B1 = µ0i 4πR(cosθ1 +cosθ2) Puttingθ1 =θ2 =45◦andR=a/2 B1 = µ0i√2πa Fields due to four sides are equal and additive. Therefore net ﬁeld B=4B1 =2√2µ0i πa Fig. 13.23Magnetic induction at the centre of a square conducting loop 13.25The magnetic ﬁelds in the upper branch and lower branch act in the opposite direction.

Then B=B1 +B2 = µ0i 2πR ( 1+3π 4 ) Fig. 13.24Magnetic induction at the centre of a current-carrying wire made of three-fourths of a circle and a chord 13.27(a) The magnetic induction due to straight wires is B1 = µ0i 4πR + µ0i 4πR = µ0i 2πR (1) because straight wires are of inﬁnite length only on left side. Induction at 0 due to semicircular portion is B2 =µ0i 4R (2) Total magnetic induction B=B1 +B2 = µ0i 2πR +µ0i 4R = µ0i 4πR(2+π) (b)The straight portions of the wire do not contribute to the ﬁeld at O as the current is directed towards C and makes an angleθ =0◦,f o rw h i c ht h e Biot–Savart formula givesB=0. Thus the entire induction comes from the semicircular portion of the wire for whichB=µ0i 4R. 13.28(a) Let the angleθ be subtended at the centre by one side AC of a regular n-sided polygon, Fig.13.25.T h e n Fig. 13.25Magnetic induction at the centre of a current-carrying regular n-sided polygon θ =2π n orθ 2 =π n (1) The magnetic induction due to one side AC at the centre O is B1 = µ0i 4πr (cosα+cosα)=µ0i cosα 2πr (2) wherer is the distance of O from AC. The ﬁeldBdue tonsides will be additive and is given by B=nB1 =µ0ni cosα 2πr (3) Nowr =asinα,s ot h a ti n( 3 ) cosα r = cosα asinα = 1 a cotα= 1 a tan (θ 2 ) = 1 a tan (π n ) (4) where we have used (1). Using (4) in (3) B= µ0ni 2πatan (π n ) (5) (b)In the limitn→∞,t a n (π n ) →π n and (5) becomes B=µ0i 2a an expression which is identical forBfor a circular loop. This is reason- able since asn→∞,p o l y g o n→circle. 13.29For squarel =4aand for circlel =2πr ∴ a r =π 2 (1) At the centre of the circle,Bc =µ0i 2r . At the centre of the square,Bs =2√2µ0i πa via prob. (13.24). ∴ Bc Bs = π 4√2 a r = π2 8√2 =0.87 13.30(a) The magnetic inductionBat the centre of a circular wire isB = µ0i 2r . Hence for the arc which subtends an angleθ at the centre B=µ0i 2r θ 2π =µ0iθ 4πr Induction atCdue to the inner arc is B1 = µ0iθ 4πR1 and due to the outer arc B2 =−µ0iθ 4πR2 The negative sign arises due to the fact that the current has reversed. As the radial part of the path points towards C, it does not contribute toB. Therefore, the resultant induction is B=B1 +B2 =µ0iθ 4π ( 1 R1 − 1 R2 ) Note that for clockwise current we takeB as positive and for counter- clockwise we takeBas negative. (b)Putθ =πto obtain B=µ0i 4 ( 1 R1 − 1 R2 ) 13.31The total induction is given by addingBs due to the straight conductor which contributes on both sides ofP andBc due to the circular path, both being directed out of page (Fig.13.9) Bs = µ0i 2πR Bc =µ0i 2R B=Bs +Bc = µ0i 2πR(π+1) 13.32dB=µ0i 4π ds×r r3 (Biot–Savart law) (1) The magnetic induction dBat P on thez-axis due to an element of length dlof the ring is shown in Fig.13.26. Resolving dBalongz-axis and perpendicular to it, and summing over all such elements it is seen that the perpendicular components vanish for reasons of symmetry and the parallel components get added up. Writing dl for ds and noting that the angle betweenRand dl is 90◦,( 1 )c a n be written as dBz =(dB) cosα=(µ0irdl) cosα 4πr3 (2) Writing dl = Rdφ,w h e r eφ is the azimuth angle andr cosα = R,( 2 ) becomes Fig. 13.26Magnetic induction on the axis of a current-carrying ring dBz =µ0iR2dφ 4πr3 (3) Integrating Bz =B= ∫ dBz =µ0iR2 4πr3 2π∫ 0 dφ= µ0iR2 2(R2 +z2)3/2 (4) 13.33B=µ0Ni l =4π×10−7 ×500×5 1.0 =3.14×10−3T 13.34B=µ0I 2π [1 x + 1 d−x ] 13.35Apply Ampere’s law inside the hollow cylindrical conductor (B)(2πr)=µ0iπ(r2 −a2) π(b2 −a2) (1) where the right-hand side includes only the fraction of the current that passes through the surface enclosed by the path of integration. Solving forB, B= µ0i 2πr (r2 −a2) (b2 −a2). 13.36Magnetic ﬁeld at P, due to loop A is BA = µ0INR2 2(R2 +x2)3/2 (1) wherex =AP= R 2.S i m i l a r l yt h em a g n e t i cﬁ e l dBc due to the second loop is given by an identical expression withx =CP= R 2.

It consists of an evacuated ‘doughnut’ in which the electrons are made to circulate under the inﬂuence of changing magnetic ﬁeld. If a magnetic ﬂuxφchanges in an electromagnet, it accelerates the electrons and at the same time holds them in an orbit of ﬁxed radius.

Consequently charge concentration builds up towards the upper edge of the strip. As the charges collect on one side of the strip they set up an electric ﬁeld that opposes sideways motion of additional charge carriers inside the conductor. This build up of charges establishes a potentialVH across the width of the strip, called Hall potential and the phenomenon is known as Hall effect. Eventually equilibrium conditions are reached and a maximum voltage, known as Hall voltage, is quickly established. The sign of the voltage gives the sign of charge carriers and its magnitude the number densitynof charge carriers: Fig. 13.32Hall effect (a) EH =vdB=iB ne = iB newb = 100×10 1.25×1030×1.6×10−19×10−3 ×0.02=2.5×10−4V/m The ﬁeld is along positivey-direction.

The total time of ﬂight is then (Fig.15.15) t = p∑ i=1 si νi =1 c p∑ i=1 nisi (1) The last summation is known as the optical path length (O.P.L). Fermat’s principle states that a ray of light traverses from one point to another by a route which takes least time. A more, stringent formulation of Fermat’s principle is as follows. A ray of light in traversing from one point to another, regardless of the media, adopts such a route which corresponds to stationary value of the optical path length: O.P.L= ∫B A n(s)ds (2) Fig. 15.15 Af u n c t i o nf(x)is said to have a stationary value atx =x0, if its derivation df/dxvanishes atx =x0.As t a t i o n a r yv a l u ec o u l dc o r r e s p o n dt oam a x i m u m or minimum.

On a sunny day, a road gets heated and a temperature gradient is established in the vertical direction with the upper air layer being slightly less warmer and the corresponding indices of refraction being slightly larger. As the rays penetrate the atmospheric depth they start bending due to refraction, becoming horizontal to the road and then bending upwards. The blue of the sky in the background produces a virtual image of a water pool, and the turbulence of air close to the road enhances the effect of a water pool with waves on the surface. This phenomenon is known as mirage.

If cladding is not used then the signal is attenuated dramatically. (b)Let a ray be incident at an angleθ,F i g .15.6, the angle of refraction at P beingθp.L e tCbe the critical angle atQ,i n t e r f a c eo fc o r ea n dc l a d d i n g : sinC=n1 n2 wheren1 andn2 are the indices of the cladding and core, respectively: θp =90−θin whereθinis the angle of incidence atQ: n0sinθ =n2sinθp =n2sin(90−θin)=n2cosθin For internal reﬂectionθin >Cor cosθr <cosC ∴ n0sinθ ≤n2cosC But n2cosC=n2 √1−sin2C= √ n22 −n21 ∴ n0sinθ ≤ √ n22 −n21 This shows that there is a maximum angle of acceptance cone outside of which entering rays will not be totally reﬂected within the ﬁbre. For the largest acceptance cone, it is desirable to choose the index of refraction of the cladding to be as small as possible. This is achieved if there is no cladding at all. However, this leads to other problems associated with the loss of intensity. (c) The transmission is reduced due to multiple reﬂections and the absorption of the ﬁbre core material due to impurities. 15.6With reference to Fig.15.6,u s i n gS n e l l ’ sl a w n2sinr1 =n1sin 20◦ ∴ sinr1 =n1 n2 sin 20◦ =1.1 1.6 ×0.342=0.2351 ∴ r1 =13.6◦ From the geometry of Fig.15.16 r2 =40−13.6◦ =26.4◦ (∵ r1 +r2 =A, the apex angle) n1sini2 =n2sinr2 sini2 =n2 n1 sinr2 =1.6 1.1sin 26.4◦ =0.6467 ∴ i2 =40.3◦ ∴ φ=90◦−40.3◦ =49.7◦ θ =80−49.7◦ =30.3◦ (∵The exterior angle is equal to the sum of the interior angles).

Note that the height of the image is only one-eighth of that of the object, but the image is closer than the object by a factor of 64, so it subtends an angle eight times large, that is, the image appears eight times larger. 15.16(a) The Intensity is given by I = power cross-section= W A = 1000 10−5 ×10−4 =1012W/m2 (b) I =1 2ε0cE20 E0 = √ 2I ε0c = √ 2×1012 8.85×10−12×3×108 =2.74×107V/m 15.17Assume that light is always incident from the left, then the refracting surface is convex ifr is positive (fromV toC)a n dc o n c a v ei fr is negative (fromV toC′), Fig.15.24.

In three dimensions, the locus of P would be a hyperboloid, the ﬁgure of revolution of the hyperbola. In an actual Young’s experiment on the observation of interference fringes one looks at a limited ﬁeld of view and consequently the central portions of hyperbolas appear as straight lines as in Fig.15.29(within the dotted lines). Fig. 15.29Interference fringes in Young’s experiment 15.21At any point P on the screen at a distanceyfrom the axis, the phase difference due to the waves coming fromS1 andS2 will be due to the optical path difference (S2P−S1P), Fig.15.11: δ=2π λ (S2P−S1P) (1) If(S2P−S1P) =nλ(n =0,1,2,... ),t h ep h a s ed i f f e r e n c eδ =2nπ,a n d the intensity is maximum at P: If(S2P−S1P) = ( m+1 2 ) λ,w h e r em = 0,1,2,...,t h ep h a s ed i f f e r - ence,δ =(2m+1)π and the intensity will be zero at P. With reference to Fig.15.11, (S2P)2 =L2 +(x+d/2)2 (S1P)2 =L2 +(x−d/2)2 ∴ (S2P)2 −(S1P)2 =(S2P+S1P)(S2P−S1P)=2xd In practicedis quite small, typically 0.5 mm, compared toL,t y p i c a l l y1 . 0m , andP is close to the axis,y <<L,s ot h a tS1Pa sw e l la sS2P are only slightly greater thanL.W ec a nt h e ns e tS2P+S1P=2L.T h e r e f o r e S2P−S1P=2xd 2L = xd L (2) Therefore, the condition for maximum intensity at P is xd L =mλ (bright fringes) (3) and the condition for zero intensity at P is xd L = ( m+1 2 ) λ (dark fringes) (4) mis called the order of fringe system. On the axis, aty = 0,m = 0a n d we have the intensity maximum.

Clearly S1O+(µ−1)t >S2O Consequently, the central fringe corresponding to zero path difference is not formed at O, the normal position of the central fringe in the absence of the plate. The new position of the central fringe would be at O′ such that S1O′ +(µ−1)t =S2O′ Fig. 15.30Shift of fringes when a transparent plate is introduced in the path of one of the rays in Young’s double-slit experiment But S2O′ −S1O′ = d L · OO′ Calling OO′ =/Delta1,t h ed i s t a n c et h r o u g hw h i c ht h ec e n t r a lf r i n g es h i f t s , /Delta1= L d(µ−1)t Furthermore,(µ−1)t =nλ. This shift is towards the side on which the plate is placed. Note that the bandwidth of the fringe system is unaffected and the entire fringe system undergoes a lateral shift. With the use of monochromatic light it is not possible to detect shift of fringes. However, if white light is used then the central fringe being white is easily distinguished from the coloured fringes and its shift can be easily measured. Thus, by the use of the above procedure the thickness of the plate can be accurately measured. 15.23(a)L e t t w o l i g h t w a v e s o f t h e s a m e w a v e l e n g t hλ and amplitudeA pass through a given point and be represented by y1 =Asinωt (1) y2 =Asin(ωt −δ) (2) whereω = 2πνandδ = constant phase difference between the two waves. The resulting displacement is then given by y =y1 +y2 =Asinωt +Asin(ωt −δ) =2Acosδ 2sin [ ωt −δ 2 ] (3) where we have used the identity sinB+sinC=2s i n (B+C 2 ) cos (B−C 2 ) (4) Equation (3) represents simple harmonic vibration of frequencyω/2π and amplitudeA′ =2A cos(δ/2).T h ea m p l i t u d eo ft h er e s u l t i n gw a v e varies from 2Athrough 0 to−2Aaccording to the value ofδ.

The bright central fringe occurs atx = 0, in the centre of the fringe system. The other bright fringes are sep- arated by distance,x = λL/d,2 λL/d,3 λL/d ... on either side. Halfway between two neighbouring bright fringes, the centres of dark fringes occur. The light intensity does not drop off suddenly but varies as cos2(δ/2).A tm a x i m at h ei n t e n s i t yr e a c h e sav a l u eo f4A2,a n da t minima, it is equal to zero. At other points it is given by (6). Thus the intensity in the interference pattern varies between 4A2 and zero. In the absence of interference each beam would contributeA2 so that from two incoherent sources, there would be a uniform intensity of 2A2, which is indicated by the horizontal dotted line.

Two different sets of fringes arise due to two wavelengths. If M1 is slowly moved away there is a gradual separation of the two sets, and ﬁnally the bright band of the one lies over the dark band of the other, resulting in uniform illumination. Thus the fringes disappear and reappear periodically. Between two successive disappearances the mirror has to be moved by, saydcm. This corresponds to a path differ- ence of 2dcm.

If the slit widthais maintained con- stant and the separation of the slitsd is varied, the scale of the interfer- ence pattern varies, but that of the diffraction pattern remains unchanged. If the diffraction angle corresponds to the minimum given by (1) then a particular order of interference maxima may be absent. This is called a missing order. Thus, a missing order is realized for an angleθ for which the following two equations are simultaneously satisﬁed: dsinθ =mλ(m=1,2,3... ) (1) asinθ =nλ(n=1,2,3... ) (2) Dividing (1) by (2) d a =m n (3) Sincemandnare both integers, missing orders will occur whend/ais in the ratio of two integers. Expressingd as the sum of the slit widtha and the opaque spacebbetween consecutive slits, that is d =a+b (4) (3) an be written as a+b a =m n (5) In particular, ifa+ba =1, b =0. In this case the ﬁrst-order spectrum will be absent and the resultant diffraction pattern will be similar to that of a single slit. If a+ba =2, a =b,t h a ti st h ew i d t ho ft h es l i ti se q u a lt ot h ew i d t ho f the opaque space. Here the second-order spectrum will be absent. (b) a+b a =m n 0.16+0.8 0.16 =6=m n The above relation is satisﬁed for n=1,2,3,... m=6,12,18,... Thus the order 6, 12, 18, etc. of the interference maxima will be missing, in the diffraction pattern. 15.47The central diffraction peak is limited by the ﬁrst minima. The angular loca- tions of these minima are given by asinθ =λ (∵ m=1) (1) The angular locations of the bright interference fringes are given by dsinθ =mλ (m=0,1,2... ) (2) We can locate the ﬁrst diffraction minimum within the double-slit fringe pat- tern by dividing (2) by (1) n=d a n= 0.2 0.012=16.66 Therefore 16 interference fringes will lie within the central maximum. 15.48m1λ1 =m2λ2 λ1 =m2λ2 m1 =3 4 ×5460=4095 Å 15.49dsinθ =mλ For m=mmax,θ =θmax=90◦, Given1 d =5000 mmax=d λ = 1 5000× 1 6×10−5 =3.33 ∴ mmax=3 15.50d a =m n (condition for missing orders) 0.3 0.1 =3 1 =m n wheremandnare integers. The above relation is satisﬁed for m=3,6,9 n=1,2,3 Thus the maxima will be missing in the third, sixth, ninth, etc. orders. 15.51d a =a+b a =a+2a a =3=m n The above relation is satisﬁed for m=3,6,9,... n=1,2,3,... Thus the interference maxima will be missing in the third, sixth, ninth, etc. orders. 15.52n1(max)= d λ1 = 1 Nλ1 = 1 4000×4×10−5 =6.25 n2(max)= d λ2 = 1 Nλ2 = 1 4000×7×10−5 =3.57 The maximum order of spectrum varies between 3 (towards red) and 6 (towards violet). 15.53d a =a+b a =a+a a =2=m n (condition for missing orders) ∴ m=2n The above condition is satisﬁed for n=1,2,3... m=2,4,6... Thus all the even orders of interference fringes (2, 4, 6,...), exceptm=0, are missing. 15.54The secondary maxima lie approximately halfway between the minima. Now, the intensity at an angleθ is given by Iθ =Im (sinα α )2 (1) where α=πa λ sinθ (2) Minima occur in (1) when α=mπ (m=1,2,3... ) (3) Therefore the ﬁrst secondary maximum would occur halfway between ﬁrst minimum and second minimum. Therefore, α= ( m+1 2 ) π=3π 2 (4) Substituting (4) into (1) I Im = (sin(3π/2) 3πl2 )2 =0.045 or 4.5% 15.55In Fig.15.34the grating space AD=d.I nt h e/Delta1ABD, BˆAD=i,t h ea n g l e of incidence.

Because the light reaching the second sheet is polarized, the intensityI2 of the light transmitted by that sheet is given by the cosine-squared rule. The angleθ in the rule is the angle between the polarization direction of the incoming light, parallel to they-axis, and the polarizing direction of the second sheet,θ being counterclockwise from they-axis. Thus I2 =I1cos2θ (Malus’ law) (2) Because the light entering the third sheet is polarized and the polarizing between the second and the third sheets is 90−θ, the transmitted intensity is again given by Malus’ law. Thus I3 =I2Cos2(90−θ)=I2sin2θ (3) From (3), (2) and (1) I3 =I2sin2θ =I1cos2θsin2θ = I0 2 cos2θ(1−cos2θ) (4) or I3 I0 =0.1152=1 2cos2θ (1−cos2θ) or cos4θ−cos2θ+0.2304=0 ∴ cos2θ =0.64 or 0.36 or cosθ =±0.8o r±0.6 Taking only the positive value θ =36.87◦or 53.13◦ The polarization is along thex-axis. 15.72Let an unpolarized light beam be incident from air on a dielectric such as glass. TheEvector for the wave can be resolved into two components – one parallel to the plane of incidence, that is, the plane of paper and the second one perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The former one is represented by double arrow and is calledπ-component while the latter shown by dots is known asσ-component; Fig.15.36. Fig. 15.36Polarization by reﬂection•σ-component↔π-component For a given dielectric, there is a particular angle of incidenceip,c a l l e dt h e polarizing angle or Brewster angle, at which the reﬂected beam is completely polarized with its plane of vibration perpendicular to the plane of incidence, that is, the reﬂected beam containsσ-component alone. Experiments show that at the polarizing angle, the reﬂected and refracted beams are at right angles. This leads to Brewster’s law tanip =µ whereµ is the refractive index. Note that at the polarizing angle the π-component is entirely refracted containing some amount ofσ-component as well. Thus the transmitted light is only partially polarized. With the use of a stack of glass plates the proportion ofσ-component can be increased in the reﬂected beam from multiple reﬂections and at the same time π-component can be made richer in the transmitted beam. Thus the trans- mitted beam is rendered plane polarized with the plane of vibration in the plane of incidence. Dielectrics such as glass, water can partially or fully polarize light by reﬂec- tion. If the surface is horizontal, the light is partially or fully polarized hori- zontally resulting in a bright spot (the glare) on the surface where reﬂection takes place. Such a glare from horizontal surfaces is eliminated by mounting the lenses in polarizing glasses with their polarizing direction vertical. Fig. 15.37Brewster windows mounted on a laser tube Brewster windows are used in laser technology (Fig.15.37). The tubes of gas lasers are sealed by mounting them in such a way that laser light is incident at Brewster’s angle. Mirrors mounted outside the tube reﬂect the light back and forth through the tube. A small hole in one mirror permits the laser light to leave. Because the windows are tilted to the axis such that light is incident at Brewster’s angle, the parallel component can traverse back and forth in the tube with minimum attenuation. The perpendicular component after several traversals gets substantially attenuated. Thus the light leaving the laser is polarized in the parallel direction tanθB =µ=1.5 ∴ θB =56.3◦, which is also the inclination of the Brewster window.\n",

The wavelengths $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ for the $D_1$ and $D_2$ lines of sodium differ only by a few angstroms. Two different sets of fringes arise due to these two wavelengths. If $M_1$ is slowly moved away, there is a gradual separation of the two sets, and finally, the bright band of one lies over the dark band of the other, resulting in uniform illumination. Thus, the fringes disappear and reappear periodically. Between two successive disappearances, the mirror has to be moved by, say, $d$ cm. This corresponds to a path difference of $2d$ cm.

      "extracted_text Let an unpolarized light beam be incident from air on a dielectric such as glass. TheEvector for the wave can be resolved into two components – one parallel to the plane of incidence, that is, the plane of paper and the second one perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The former one is represented by double arrow and is calledπ-component while the latter shown by dots is known asσ-component; Fig.15.36. Fig. 15.36Polarization by reﬂection•σ-component↔π-component For a given dielectric, there is a particular angle of incidenceip,c a l l e dt h e polarizing angle or Brewster angle, at which the reﬂected beam is completely polarized with its plane of vibration perpendicular to the plane of incidence, that is, the reﬂected beam containsσ-component alone. Experiments show that at the polarizing angle, the reﬂected and refracted beams are at right angles. This leads to Brewster’s law tanip =µ whereµ is the refractive index. Note that at the polarizing angle the π-component is entirely refracted containing some amount ofσ-component as well. Thus the transmitted light is only partially polarized. With the use of a stack of glass plates the proportion ofσ-component can be increased in the reﬂected beam from multiple reﬂections and at the same time π-component can be made richer in the transmitted beam. Thus the trans- mitted beam is rendered plane polarized with the plane of vibration in the plane of incidence. Dielectrics such as glass, water can partially or fully polarize light by reﬂec- tion. If the surface is horizontal, the light is partially or fully polarized hori- zontally resulting in a bright spot (the glare) on the surface where reﬂection takes place. Such a glare from horizontal surfaces is eliminated by mounting the lenses in polarizing glasses with their polarizing direction vertical. Fig. 15.37Brewster windows mounted on a laser tube Brewster windows are used in laser technology (Fig.15.37). The tubes of gas lasers are sealed by mounting them in such a way that laser light is incident at Brewster’s angle. Mirrors mounted outside the tube reﬂect the light back and forth through the tube. A small hole in one mirror permits the laser light to leave. Because the windows are tilted to the axis such that light is incident at Brewster’s angle, the parallel component can traverse back and forth in the tube with minimum attenuation. The perpendicular component after several traversals gets substantially attenuated. Thus the light leaving the laser is polarized in the parallel direction tanθB =µ=1.5 ∴ θB =56.3◦, which is also the inclination of the Brewster window.\n",
