\section*{Problem Statement}

(a) Write down the Lagrangian for a simple pendulum constrained to move in a single vertical plane. Find from it the equation of motion and show that for small displacements from equilibrium, the pendulum performs simple harmonic motion.

(b) Consider a particle of mass $m$ moving in one dimension under a force with the potential $U(x) = k(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x)$, where the constant $k > 0$. Show that the point $x = 1$ corresponds to a stable equilibrium position of the particle. Find the frequency of a small amplitude oscillation of the particle about this equilibrium position.

\subsection*{Solution}

(a) The Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ for a simple pendulum of length $l$ and mass $m$ moving in a vertical plane is given by:

\[
\mathcal{L} = T - V = \frac{1}{2} m l^2 \dot{\theta}^2 - mgl(1 - \cos \theta)
\]

where $T$ is the kinetic energy and $V$ is the potential energy. The equation of motion can be derived using the Euler-Lagrange equation:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{\theta}} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta} = 0
\]

For small displacements, $\theta \approx \sin \theta$, leading to simple harmonic motion.

(b) The potential energy function is given by:

\[
U(x) = k(2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x)
\]

To find the equilibrium position, we set the derivative of the potential energy to zero:

\[
\frac{dU}{dx} = k(6x^2 - 10x + 4) = 0
\]

Solving for $x$, we find the equilibrium points. To determine stability, we examine the second derivative:

\[
\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = k(12x - 10)
\]

At $x = 1$, check if $\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} > 0$ for stability. The frequency of small oscillations is given by:

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m} \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} \bigg|_{x=1}}
\]

\section*{Equations of Motion for the Atwood Machine}

Consider an Atwood machine with two masses, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), connected by a string over a frictionless pulley. Let \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) be the vertical positions of masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), respectively. Assume the downward direction is positive.

The kinetic energy \( T \) of the system is given by:
\[
T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{y}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{y}_2^2
\]

The potential energy \( V \) of the system is:
\[
V = m_1 g y_1 + m_2 g y_2
\]

The Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L} \) is defined as:
\[
\mathcal{L} = T - V = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{y}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{y}_2^2 - (m_1 g y_1 + m_2 g y_2)
\]

Since the string is inextensible, the constraint is:
\[
y_1 + y_2 = \text{constant}
\]

Differentiating with respect to time, we have:
\[
\dot{y}_1 = -\dot{y}_2
\]

Substituting \(\dot{y}_1 = -\dot{y}_2\) into the Lagrangian, we get:
\[
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{y}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 \dot{y}_2^2 - (m_1 g y_1 + m_2 g y_2)
\]

Using the Euler-Lagrange equation:
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{y}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y_i} = 0
\]

Apply this to each mass to find the equations of motion.

\section*{Equations of Motion for a Double Atwood Machine}

Consider a Double Atwood machine where one of the pulleys is replaced by another Atwood machine. We denote the masses as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses on the first Atwood machine.
    \item \( m_3 \) is the mass on the second Atwood machine.
\end{itemize}

Assuming the pulleys are massless and frictionless, we can write the equations of motion based on Newton's second law.

For the first Atwood machine, the net force and acceleration \( a_1 \) can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
(m_2 - m_1)g = (m_1 + m_2)a_1
\end{equation}

For the second Atwood machine, which is connected to the first, the net force and acceleration \( a_2 \) are given by:
\begin{equation}
(m_3 - m_2)g = (m_2 + m_3)a_2
\end{equation}

Here, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. The accelerations \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) are related through the constraints of the system, which depend on the specific setup and connections between the masses.

For a simple harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \) and spring constant \( k \), the kinetic energy \( T \) and potential energy \( V \) are given by:

\section*{Problem Statement}

Two blocks of mass $m$ and $M$ connected by a massless spring of spring constant $k$ are placed on a smooth horizontal table. Determine the equations of motion using Lagrangian mechanics.

\section*{Solution}

To determine the equations of motion using Lagrangian mechanics, we first define the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ as the difference between the kinetic energy $T$ and the potential energy $V$ of the system:

\[
\mathcal{L} = T - V
\]

Assuming the blocks move along the horizontal axis, let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the positions of the masses $m$ and $M$, respectively. The kinetic energy $T$ of the system is given by:

\[
T = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}M\dot{x}_2^2
\]

The potential energy $V$ stored in the spring, assuming it follows Hooke's law, is:

\[
V = \frac{1}{2}k(x_2 - x_1)^2
\]

Thus, the Lagrangian becomes:

\[
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}M\dot{x}_2^2 - \frac{1}{2}k(x_2 - x_1)^2
\]

The equations of motion can be derived using the Euler-Lagrange equation:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{x}_i}\right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_i} = 0
\]

where $i = 1, 2$ corresponds to the two masses $m$ and $M$.

Use Hamilton’s equations to obtain the equations of motion of a uniform heavy rod of mass $M$ and length $2a$ turning about one end which is fixed.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we start by considering the system described: a uniform heavy rod of mass $M$ and length $2a$ rotating about one end. We will use Hamilton's equations to derive the equations of motion.

\subsection*{Hamilton's Equations}

Hamilton's equations are given by:

\[
\dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}, \quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}
\]

where \( q_i \) are the generalized coordinates, \( p_i \) are the conjugate momenta, and \( H \) is the Hamiltonian of the system.

\subsection*{System Description}

For a rod of length \( 2a \) and mass \( M \), rotating about one end, we can choose the angle \( \theta \) as the generalized coordinate. The kinetic energy \( T \) and potential energy \( V \) of the system can be expressed as functions of \( \theta \) and its time derivative \( \dot{\theta} \).

\subsection*{Hamiltonian Formulation}

The Lagrangian \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = T - V
\]

The Hamiltonian \( H \) is then obtained via the Legendre transform:

\[
H = \sum_i \dot{q}_i p_i - L
\]

where \( p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \).

In the Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics, the equations of motion for a system are derived from the Hamiltonian \( H \), which is a function of generalized coordinates \( \mathbf{q} \) and conjugate momenta \( \mathbf{p} \). For planetary motion, the Hamiltonian can be expressed as:

\[
H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t) = T(\mathbf{p}) + V(\mathbf{q})

\]

\[

\]

For a two-body problem, such as a planet orbiting a star, the specific form of the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) is:

- \( p_r \) and \( p_\theta \) are the radial and angular momenta, respectively,
- \( m \) is the mass of the planet,
- \( M \) is the mass of the star,
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant.

The corresponding Hamilton's equations are:

\[
\dot{r} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_r} = \frac{p_r}{m}
\]

\[
\dot{\theta} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_\theta} = \frac{p_\theta}{mr^2}

\section*{Equations of Motion for an Insect on a Rotating Rod}

Consider an insect of mass $m$ crawling at a uniform speed $v$ on a uniform heavy rod of mass $M$ and length $2a$. The rod is turning about a fixed end. Assume that at time $t = 0$, the insect is at the midpoint of the rod and is crawling downwards.

To determine the equations of motion, we consider the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let the rod be positioned along the $x$-axis with its fixed end at the origin.
    \item The position of the insect at time $t$ can be described by its distance $x(t)$ from the fixed end.
    \item The rod rotates about the fixed end with angular velocity $\omega(t)$.
\end{itemize}

The position of the insect in polar coordinates, with the origin at the fixed end of the rod, is given by:
\[
r(t) = a + vt
\]
where $a$ is the initial position of the insect at $t = 0$.

The kinetic energy $T$ of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy of the rod and the insect:
\[
T = \frac{1}{2} M \left(\frac{2a}{2}\right)^2 \omega^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \left( (a + vt)^2 \omega^2 + v^2 \right)
\]

The potential energy $V$ is zero since we assume the motion occurs in a horizontal plane.

Using the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = T - V$, we can derive the equations of motion using the Euler-Lagrange equation:
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q_i} = 0
\]
where $q_i$ represents the generalized coordinates of the system.

The equations of motion for this system will involve solving these equations for the variables $x(t)$ and $\omega(t)$.

1. **Lagrangian in Polar Coordinates:**

   The Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L} \) for a particle in a central force field is given by:
   \[
   \mathcal{L} = T - U = \frac{1}{2} m \left( \dot{r}^2 + r^2 \dot{\theta}^2 \right) - U(r)
   \]

2. **Momenta:**

   The generalized momenta are derived from the Lagrangian:
   \[
   p_r = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{r}} = m \dot{r}
   \]
   \[
   p_\theta = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = m r^2 \dot{\theta}
   \]

3. **Hamiltonian:**

   The Hamiltonian \( \mathcal{H} \) is given by:
   \[
   \mathcal{H} = p_r \dot{r} + p_\theta \dot{\theta} - \mathcal{L}
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( p_r \) and \( p_\theta \):
   \[
   \mathcal{H} = \frac{p_r^2}{2m} + \frac{p_\theta^2}{2mr^2} + U(r)
   \]

4. **Conservation of Energy and Angular Momentum:**

   - The Hamiltonian \( \mathcal{H} \) represents the total energy, which is conserved if \( \frac{d\mathcal{H}}{dt} = 0 \).
   - The angular momentum \( L = p_\theta = m r^2 \dot{\theta} \) is conserved if \( \frac{dL}{dt} = 0 \).

\section*{Problem Statement}

Two beads of mass $2m$ and $m$ can move without friction along a horizontal wire. They are connected to a fixed wall with two springs of spring constants $2k$ and $k$ as shown in Fig. 7.6:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Find the Lagrangian for this system and derive from it the equations of motion for the beads.
    \item[(b)] Find the eigenfrequencies of small amplitude oscillations.
    \item[(c)] For each normal mode, sketch the system when it is at the maximum displacement.

\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Lagrangian and Equations of Motion}

To find the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$, we consider the kinetic and potential energies of the system. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the displacements of the beads of mass $2m$ and $m$, respectively.

The kinetic energy $T$ is given by:
\[
T = \frac{1}{2}(2m)\dot{x}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}_2^2
\]

The potential energy $V$ due to the springs is:
\[
V = \frac{1}{2}(2k)x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}k(x_2 - x_1)^2
\]

Thus, the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ is:
\[
\mathcal{L} = T - V = \frac{1}{2}(2m)\dot{x}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}_2^2 - \left( \frac{1}{2}(2k)x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}k(x_2 - x_1)^2 \right)
\]

Using the Euler-Lagrange equation, derive the equations of motion for $x_1$ and $x_2$.

\subsection*{(b) Eigenfrequencies}

To find the eigenfrequencies, linearize the equations of motion around the equilibrium position and solve for the normal modes of oscillation. Assume small displacements and use the method of normal coordinates.

\subsection*{(c) Normal Modes}

For each normal mode, sketch the system when it is at the maximum displacement. Consider the relative motion of the beads and the deformation of the springs.

Write down the Lagrangian, taking the angle $\vartheta$ with respect to the vertical direction as the generalized coordinate. Hence, derive the equation of motion for the particle. Fig. 7.8

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(i)] Write down the Lagrangian in terms of the angle $\theta$ and the $x$-coordinate of the bowl, $x$.
        \item[(ii)] Starting from the corresponding Lagrange's equations, obtain an equation giving $\ddot{x}$ in terms of $\theta$, $\dot{\theta}$, and $\ddot{\theta}$ and an equation giving $\ddot{\theta}$ in terms of $\ddot{x}$ and $\theta$.
        \item[(iii)] Hence, and assuming that $M \gg m$, show that for small displacements about equilibrium the period of oscillation of the particle is smaller by a factor $\sqrt{\frac{M}{M+m}}$ as compared to the case where the bowl is fixed.

A system is described by the single (generalized) coordinate $q$ and the Lagrangian $L(q, \dot{q})$. Define the generalized momentum associated with $q$ and the corresponding Hamiltonian, $H(q, p)$. Derive Hamilton’s equations from Lagrange’s equations of the system. For the remainder of the question, consider the system whose Lagrangian is $L(q, \dot{q})$. Find the corresponding Hamiltonian and write down Hamilton’s equations.

\section*{Definitions}

The generalized momentum $p$ associated with the coordinate $q$ is defined as:
\[
p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}

The Hamiltonian $H(q, p)$ is given by the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian:
\[
H(q, p) = p \dot{q} - L(q, \dot{q})

\section*{Generalized Momentum and Lagrangian Dynamics}

The \textit{generalized (or canonical) momentum} conjugate to a generalized coordinate is defined in the context of Lagrangian mechanics. For a system described by a set of generalized coordinates $\{q_i\}$, the generalized momentum $p_i$ conjugate to the coordinate $q_i$ is given by:

\[
p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}
\]

where $L$ is the Lagrangian of the system, and $\dot{q}_i$ is the time derivative of the coordinate $q_i$. The characteristic feature that the Lagrangian function must have for a generalized momentum to be a constant of motion is that the Lagrangian does not explicitly depend on the corresponding generalized coordinate $q_i$. This is a consequence of Noether's theorem, which relates symmetries and conservation laws.

\section*{Problem Description}

Consider a particle $P$ sliding on a frictionless horizontal table with a small opening at $O$. It is attached by a string of length $l$ passing through the opening to a particle $Q$ hanging vertically under the table. The two particles have equal mass, $m$. Let $\tau$ denote the distance of $P$ to the opening, $\theta$ the angle between $OP$ and some fixed line through $O$, and $g$ the acceleration due to gravity. Initially, $r = a$, $Q$ does not move, and $P$ is given an initial velocity of magnitude $\sqrt{ag}$ at right angles to $OP$. Refer to Fig. 7.9 for a visual representation.

\subsection*{(a) Lagrangian and Equations of Motion}

Write the Lagrangian in terms of the coordinates $r$ and $\theta$ and derive the corresponding equations of motion.

\subsection*{(b) Equations of Motion and Initial Conditions}

Using these equations of motion and the initial conditions, show that:

\[
\ddot{r} = \frac{a^3 g}{r^3} - g
\]

\subsection*{(c) Analysis of the Trajectory}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(i)] Show that the trajectory of $P$ is the circle $r = a$.
    \item[(ii)] Show that $P$ describes small oscillations about this circle if it is slightly displaced from it.
    \item[(iii)] Calculate the period of these oscillations.
\end{itemize}

The speed of $P$ is given by:

\[
v_p^2 = \dot{r}^2 + r^2 \dot{\theta}^2
\]

A particle of mass $m$ is constrained to move on an ellipse $E$ in a vertical plane, parametrized by $x = a \cos \theta$, $y = b \sin \theta$, where $a, b > 0$ and $a \neq b$, and the positive $y$-direction is the upward vertical. The particle is connected to the origin by a spring, as shown in the diagram, and is subject to gravity. The potential energy in the spring is $\frac{1}{2} k r^2$ where $r$ is the distance of the point mass from the origin (Fig. 7.10).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] Using $\theta$ as a coordinate, find the kinetic and potential energies of the particle when moving on the ellipse. Write down the Lagrangian and show that Lagrange’s equation becomes:
