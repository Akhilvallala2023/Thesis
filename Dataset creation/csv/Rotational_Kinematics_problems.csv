\section*{Physics Problem: Loop-the-loop}

A particle starts at height \( h \) on the slide and acquires a velocity \( v \) at the bottom of the loop. If \( v < \sqrt{2gR} \), the particle will not be able to climb up beyond the point \( B \). It will oscillate in the lower semicircle about the point \( D \). If \( \sqrt{2gR} < v < \sqrt{5gR} \), the particle will be able to climb up the arc \( BC \) and leave at some point \( E \) and describe a parabolic path. If \( v > \sqrt{5gR} \), the particle will be able to execute a complete circle. This corresponds to a height \( h = 2.5R \).

\section*{Description}

The conical pendulum consists of a bob of mass \( m \) attached to the end of an inflexible light string tied to a fixed point \( O \) and swung around so that it describes a circle in a horizontal plane. While revolving, the string generates a conical surface around the vertical axis \( ON \), with the height of the cone being \( ON = H \), the projection of \( OP \) on the vertical axis (see Fig. 3.2).

\section*{Objective}

Show that the angular velocity of the bob is given by

\begin{document}

The bob of a pendulum is displaced through an angle $\theta$ with the vertical line and is gently released so that it begins to swing in a vertical circle. When it passes through the lowest point, the string experiences a tension equal to double the weight of the bob. Determine $\theta$.

\begin{align*}
    \text{Let } m & \text{ be the mass of the bob,} \\
    g & \text{ be the acceleration due to gravity, and} \\
    T & \text{ be the tension in the string at the lowest point.}
\end{align*}

At the lowest point, the forces acting on the bob are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The tension $T$ in the string, acting upwards.
    \item The weight of the bob $mg$, acting downwards.
\end{itemize}

According to the problem, the tension is double the weight of the bob:
\[
T = 2mg
\]

Using the centripetal force equation at the lowest point, we have:
\[
T - mg = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\]

Substituting $T = 2mg$ into the equation:
\[
2mg - mg = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
mg = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\]

The velocity $v$ at the lowest point can be found using energy conservation between the highest point and the lowest point:
\[
mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

Where $h = r(1 - \cos\theta)$ is the vertical height difference. Thus:
\[
mgr(1 - \cos\theta) = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

Substitute $v^2 = 2gr(1 - \cos\theta)$ into the centripetal force equation:
\[
mg = \frac{m(2gr(1 - \cos\theta))}{r}
\]

Simplifying, we have:
\[
g = 2g(1 - \cos\theta)
\]

Solving for $\cos\theta$, we get:
\[
1 = 2(1 - \cos\theta)
\]

\[
1 = 2 - 2\cos\theta
\]

\[
2\cos\theta = 1
\]

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Therefore, the angle $\theta$ is:
\[
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)

As a mass $m$ slides along the frictionless loop-the-loop track as shown in Fig. 3.7, if it starts at point $A$ at the height $h = 5R$ from the bottom of the track, then show that the resultant force acting on the track at point $B$ at height $R$ will be $\sqrt{65} \, mg$.

This LaTeX code includes:
- Proper mathematical notation for variables and expressions.
- A figure environment to include the referenced figure (note that you need to replace `loop-the-loop.png` with the actual path to your image file).
- A structured sentence to clearly state the physics problem."

A particle of mass $m$ is moving in a vertical circle of radius $R$. When $m$ is at the lowest position, its speed is $0.8944\sqrt{5gR}$. The particle will move up the track to some point $p$ at which it will lose contact with the track and travel along a path shown by the dotted line (see Fig. 3.8). Show that the angular position $\theta$ will be $30^\circ$. 

\begin{figure}[h]

In this LaTeX code:
- The mass of the particle is denoted by $m$.
- The radius of the circle is denoted by $R$.
- The speed of the particle at the lowest position is given as $0.8944\sqrt{5gR}$.
- The angular position $\theta$ is to be shown as $30^\circ$.
- A placeholder for the figure (Fig. 3.8) is included, which you should replace with the actual image file of the figure."

An \textit{a i li sl o c a t e d} at a certain distance vertically below the point of suspension of a simple pendulum. The pendulum bob is released from a position where the string makes an angle $60^\circ$ with the vertical.

A test tube of mass \(10 \, \text{g}\) closed with a cork of mass \(1 \, \text{g}\) contains some ether. When the test tube is heated, the cork flies out under the pressure of the ether gas. The test tube is suspended by a weightless rigid bar of length \(5 \, \text{cm}\). What is the minimum velocity with which the cork would fly out of the test tube so that the test tube describes a full vertical circle about the point of suspension? Neglect the mass of ether.

\begin{align}
    x &= a \cos t \quad \text{(1)} \\
    y &= a \sin t \quad \text{(2)} \\
    z &= t \quad \text{(3)}
\end{align}

Squaring (1) and (2) and adding:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = a^2 (\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t) = a^2
\]

which is the equation of a circle. Since \(z = t\), the circular path drifts along the \(z\)-axis so that the path is a helix.
