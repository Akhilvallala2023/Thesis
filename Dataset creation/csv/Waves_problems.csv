8.1,"To demonstrate that the one-dimensional wave equation is satisfied by the function \( y = A\sqrt{x + vt} \), we need to consider the standard form of the one-dimensional wave equation and substitute the given function into it. Here is the properly formatted LaTeX code for this task:

\section*{Verification of the Wave Equation}

The one-dimensional wave equation is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = v^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation}

We need to show that this equation is satisfied by the function:
\begin{equation}
    y = A\sqrt{x + vt}
\end{equation}

First, compute the first partial derivatives:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} &= \frac{A}{2\sqrt{x + vt}} \\
    \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} &= \frac{Av}{2\sqrt{x + vt}}
\end{align}

Next, compute the second partial derivatives:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= -\frac{A}{4(x + vt)^{3/2}} \\
    \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} &= -\frac{Av^2}{4(x + vt)^{3/2}}
\end{align}

Substitute these into the wave equation:
\begin{equation}
    -\frac{Av^2}{4(x + vt)^{3/2}} = v^2 \left(-\frac{A}{4(x + vt)^{3/2}}\right)
\end{equation}

Both sides of the equation are equal, thus confirming that the function \( y = A\sqrt{x + vt} \) satisfies the one-dimensional wave equation.

This LaTeX document outlines the steps to verify that the given function satisfies the one-dimensional wave equation by calculating the necessary partial derivatives and substituting them into the wave equation."
8.2,"To show that the given equation for a standing wave is a solution of the wave equation, we need to format both the standing wave equation and the wave equation in LaTeX. Here's how you can write it:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

Show that the equation for a standing wave:

\[
y(x, t) = 2A \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \cos(2\pi f t)
\]

is a solution of the wave equation:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\mu}{F} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}
\]

where \( F \) is the tension and \( \mu \) is the mass per unit length.

```

This LaTeX code will properly format the given physics problem, showing both the standing wave equation and the wave equation clearly."

8.4,"To convert the given physics text into properly formatted LaTeX, we need to write the expressions for the waves and the problem statement clearly. Here's the LaTeX code:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

Show that the superposition of the waves \( y_1 = A \sin(kx - \omega t) \) and \( y_2 = 3A \sin(kx + \omega t) \) is a pure standing wave plus a travelling wave in the negative direction along the \( x \)-axis. Find the amplitude of 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item the standing wave, and
    \item the travelling wave.
\end{enumerate}
