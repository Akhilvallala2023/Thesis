8.1,"To show that the one-dimensional wave equation is satisfied by the function \( y = A\sqrt{x+vt} \), we need to substitute this function into the wave equation and verify that it holds true.

The one-dimensional wave equation is given by:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = v^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}
\]

Given the function \( y = A\sqrt{x+vt} \), let's compute the necessary partial derivatives.

First, compute the first partial derivatives:

\[
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = \frac{A}{2\sqrt{x+vt}} \cdot v = \frac{Av}{2\sqrt{x+vt}}
\]

\[
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \frac{A}{2\sqrt{x+vt}}
\]

Next, compute the second partial derivatives:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{Av}{2\sqrt{x+vt}} \right) = -\frac{Av^2}{4(x+vt)^{3/2}}
\]

\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{A}{2\sqrt{x+vt}} \right) = -\frac{A}{4(x+vt)^{3/2}}
\]

Substitute these into the wave equation:

\[
-\frac{Av^2}{4(x+vt)^{3/2}} = v^2 \left( -\frac{A}{4(x+vt)^{3/2}} \right)
\]

Simplifying both sides:

\[
-\frac{Av^2}{4(x+vt)^{3/2}} = -\frac{Av^2}{4(x+vt)^{3/2}}
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the function \( y = A\sqrt{x+vt} \) satisfies the one-dimensional wave equation. Therefore, the function is indeed a solution to the wave equation."
8.2,"To show that the equation \( y = 2A \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \cos(2\pi ft) \) is a solution of the wave equation 

\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\mu}{F} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}
\]

where \( F \) is the tension and \( \mu \) is the mass per unit length, we need to compute the second partial derivatives of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) and \( t \), and then verify that they satisfy the wave equation.

First, compute the second partial derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \):

\[
y = 2A \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \cos(2\pi ft)
\]

\[
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = 2A \cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \cdot \frac{n\pi}{L} \cos(2\pi ft)
\]

\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = -2A \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{n\pi}{L}\right)^2 \cos(2\pi ft)
\]

Next, compute the second partial derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( t \):

\[
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = -2A \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \cdot 2\pi f \sin(2\pi ft)
\]

\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = -2A \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \cdot (2\pi f)^2 \cos(2\pi ft)
\]

Substitute these into the wave equation:

\[
-2A \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \left(\frac{n\pi}{L}\right)^2 \cos(2\pi ft) = \frac{\mu}{F} \left(-2A \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) (2\pi f)^2 \cos(2\pi ft)\right)
\]

Simplifying both sides, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{n\pi}{L}\right)^2 = \frac{\mu}{F} (2\pi f)^2
\]

This confirms that the equation \( y = 2A \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \cos(2\pi ft) \) satisfies the wave equation, given that the relationship between the wave parameters is maintained."

8.4,"To demonstrate that the superposition of the given waves is a pure standing wave plus a traveling wave, we start by considering the two wave functions:

\[ y_1 = A \sin(kx - \omega t) \]
\[ y_2 = 3A \sin(kx + \omega t) \]

The superposition of these waves is given by:

\[ y = y_1 + y_2 = A \sin(kx - \omega t) + 3A \sin(kx + \omega t) \]

Using the trigonometric identity for the sum of sines:

\[
\sin \alpha + \sin \beta = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\alpha + \beta}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\alpha - \beta}{2} \right)
\]

we can rewrite the superposition as:

\[
y = A \left[ \sin(kx - \omega t) + 3 \sin(kx + \omega t) \right]
\]

Applying the identity to each term separately, we have:

\[
y = A \left[ 2 \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t) + 2 \cdot 3 \cos(kx) \sin(\omega t) \right]
\]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[
y = 2A \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t) + 6A \cos(kx) \sin(\omega t)
\]

This expression can be interpreted as a combination of a standing wave and a traveling wave. The first term, \(2A \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t)\), represents a standing wave, while the second term, \(6A \cos(kx) \sin(\omega t)\), represents a traveling wave.

Thus, the amplitude of the standing wave is:

\[
(a) \quad 2A
\]

And the amplitude of the traveling wave is:

\[
(b) \quad 6A
\]

This completes the demonstration that the superposition of the two waves results in a pure standing wave plus a traveling wave in the negative direction along the \(x\)-axis."

8.6,"To convert the given physics text into properly formatted LaTeX, we need to write the equation of the sinusoidal wave traveling in the \(+x\) direction. The wave is described by its wave number \(k\), angular frequency \(\omega\), amplitude \(A\), and initial conditions. Here is the LaTeX code for the problem:

```latex

\begin{document}

A sinusoidal wave on a string traveling in the \(+x\) direction has a wave number \(k = \frac{3}{\text{m}}\) and an angular frequency \(\omega = 20 \, \text{rad/s}\). If the amplitude is \(A = 0.2 \, \text{m}\) and the point at \(x = 0\) is at its maximum displacement at \(t = 0\), find the equation of the wave.

The general form of a sinusoidal wave traveling in the \(+x\) direction is given by:
\[
y(x, t) = A \cos(kx - \omega t + \phi)
\]

Given that the point at \(x = 0\) is at its maximum displacement at \(t = 0\), we have:
\[
y(0, 0) = A \cos(\phi) = A
\]

This implies that \(\cos(\phi) = 1\), so \(\phi = 0\).

Thus, the equation of the wave is:
\[
y(x, t) = 0.2 \cos\left(\frac{3}{\text{m}} \cdot x - 20 \, \text{rad/s} \cdot t\right)
\]

8.7,"To show that each point on a string undergoing a standing wave is in simple harmonic motion (SHM) transverse to the string, we start by considering the general equation for a standing wave on a string. A standing wave can be described by the superposition of two traveling waves moving in opposite directions. The equation for a standing wave can be written as:

\[
y(x, t) = A \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t)
\]

where:
- \( y(x, t) \) is the displacement of the string at position \( x \) and time \( t \),
- \( A \) is the amplitude of the standing wave,
- \( k \) is the wave number, related to the wavelength \(\lambda\) by \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \),
- \( \omega \) is the angular frequency, related to the period \( T \) by \( \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} \).

In this equation, the term \(\sin(kx)\) determines the spatial variation of the wave, while \(\cos(\omega t)\) describes the temporal variation. Each point on the string oscillates with a time-dependent factor \(\cos(\omega t)\), which is characteristic of simple harmonic motion.

To demonstrate that each point undergoes SHM, we focus on the temporal part of the wave equation:

\[
y(x, t) = A \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t)
\]

For a fixed position \( x \), the displacement \( y(x, t) \) is given by:

\[
y(t) = A \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t)
\]

This equation is of the form:

\[
y(t) = A' \cos(\omega t)
\]

where \( A' = A \sin(kx) \) is a constant for a given \( x \). This is the standard form of simple harmonic motion, where the displacement varies sinusoidally with time.

Thus, each point on the string oscillates with an amplitude \( A \sin(kx) \), and since \(\cos(\omega t)\) is a harmonic function, each point indeed undergoes simple harmonic motion transverse to the string. The amplitude of this motion depends on the position \( x \) along the string, reaching maximum values at antinodes (\(\sin(kx) = \pm 1\)) and zero at nodes (\(\sin(kx) = 0\))."
8.8,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the frequency of harmonics on a string:

\[
f_n = \frac{n \cdot v}{2L}
\]

where:
- \( f_n \) is the frequency of the \( n \)-th harmonic,
- \( v \) is the wave velocity,
- \( L \) is the length of the string,
- \( n \) is the harmonic number (1 for the first harmonic, 2 for the second, etc.).

Given:
- \( L = 2.0 \, \text{m} \)
- \( v = 120 \, \text{m/s} \)

We need to find the frequencies of the first three harmonics (\( n = 1, 2, 3 \)).

1. **First Harmonic (\( n = 1 \)):**

\[
f_1 = \frac{1 \cdot 120 \, \text{m/s}}{2 \cdot 2.0 \, \text{m}} = \frac{120}{4} = 30 \, \text{Hz}
\]

2. **Second Harmonic (\( n = 2 \)):**

\[
f_2 = \frac{2 \cdot 120 \, \text{m/s}}{2 \cdot 2.0 \, \text{m}} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \, \text{Hz}
\]

3. **Third Harmonic (\( n = 3 \)):**

\[
f_3 = \frac{3 \cdot 120 \, \text{m/s}}{2 \cdot 2.0 \, \text{m}} = \frac{360}{4} = 90 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Thus, the frequencies of the first three harmonics are \( 30 \, \text{Hz} \), \( 60 \, \text{Hz} \), and \( 90 \, \text{Hz} \)."

\title{Physics Problem: Resultant Amplitude of Combined Waves}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

Two sinusoidal waves having the same frequency and traveling in the same direction are combined. If their amplitudes are \(6.0 \, \text{cm}\) and \(8.0 \, \text{cm}\) and have a phase difference of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), determine the amplitude of the resultant motion.

\section*{Solution}

The amplitude of the resultant wave when two waves interfere can be determined using the formula:

\[
A = \sqrt{A_1^2 + A_2^2 + 2A_1A_2\cos\phi}
\]

where \(A_1 = 6.0 \, \text{cm}\), \(A_2 = 8.0 \, \text{cm}\), and \(\phi = \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Substituting the given values:

\[
A = \sqrt{(6.0)^2 + (8.0)^2 + 2 \times 6.0 \times 8.0 \times \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}
\]

Since \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
A = \sqrt{(6.0)^2 + (8.0)^2}
\]

\[
A = \sqrt{36 + 64}
\]

\[
A = \sqrt{100}
\]

\[
A = 10.0 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the amplitude of the resultant motion is \(10.0 \, \text{cm}\).

8.14,"To show that the one-dimensional wave equation is satisfied by the given functions, we need to verify that they satisfy the standard wave equation:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = v^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}
\]

Let's consider each function separately:

### (a) \( y = A \ln(x + vt) \)

1. **First Partial Derivatives:**

   \[
   \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = \frac{A \cdot v}{x + vt}
   \]

   \[
   \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \frac{A}{x + vt}
   \]

2. **Second Partial Derivatives:**

   \[
   \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{A \cdot v}{x + vt} \right) = \frac{-A \cdot v^2}{(x + vt)^2}
   \]

   \[
   \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{A}{x + vt} \right) = \frac{-A}{(x + vt)^2}
   \]

3. **Verification:**

   \[
   \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = v^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \implies \frac{-A \cdot v^2}{(x + vt)^2} = v^2 \left( \frac{-A}{(x + vt)^2} \right)

1. **First Partial Derivatives:**

   \]

   \[
   \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = -A \sin(x + vt)
   \]

2. **Second Partial Derivatives:**

   \[
   \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( -A \cdot v \sin(x + vt) \right) = -A \cdot v^2 \cos(x + vt)

   \[
   \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( -A \sin(x + vt) \right) = -A \cos(x + vt)

3. **Verification:**

   \[
   \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = v^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \implies -A \cdot v^2 \cos(x + vt) = v^2 \left( -A \cos(x + vt) \right)

\]

(b) Show that the third, sixth, and ninth harmonics are absent.

(a) The displacement $y(x, t)$ can be expressed as a Fourier series of the form:

\[
y(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \sin \frac{n\pi x}{L} \cos \frac{n\pi vt}{L}
\]

Given the initial condition that the string is plucked at $\frac{1}{3}$ of its length, the Fourier coefficients $A_n$ can be determined by considering the symmetry and boundary conditions of the problem. The absence of certain harmonics can be shown by calculating these coefficients.

(b) The absence of the third, sixth, and ninth harmonics implies that the coefficients $A_3$, $A_6$, and $A_9$ are zero. This can be shown by evaluating the Fourier series expansion and noting that these terms do not contribute to the displacement $y(x, t)$.

- \( k \) is the wave number,

Given:
- Amplitude \( A = 0.01 \, \text{m} \),
- Frequency \( f = 170 \, \text{Hz} \),

8.19,"To show that the average rate of energy transmission \(\overline{P}\) of a traveling sine wave on a stretched string is given by \(\overline{P} = \frac{1}{2} \mu v \omega^2 A^2\), we start by considering the properties of the wave and the string.

Given:
- Velocity of the wave: \(v\)
- Angular frequency: \(\omega\)
- Amplitude: \(A\)
- Mass per unit length of the string: \(\mu\)

The power transmitted by a wave on a string is related to the kinetic energy of the string elements as they oscillate. The instantaneous power \(P(t)\) is given by:

\[
P(t) = F v_y
\]

where \(F\) is the tension in the string and \(v_y\) is the transverse velocity of the string element.

For a sinusoidal wave described by:

\[
y(x, t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t)
\]

the transverse velocity \(v_y\) is:

\[
v_y = \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = -A \omega \cos(kx - \omega t)
\]

The average power \(\overline{P}\) over one complete cycle is:

\[
\overline{P} = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T P(t) \, dt
\]

Substituting for \(P(t)\):

\[
P(t) = F \left(-A \omega \cos(kx - \omega t)\right)
\]

The average of \(\cos^2(kx - \omega t)\) over one period is \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the average power is:

\[
\overline{P} = \frac{1}{2} F A^2 \omega^2
\]

Since the wave speed \(v\) is related to the tension and mass per unit length by:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}}
\]

we have:

\[
F = \mu v^2
\]

Substituting this into the expression for \(\overline{P}\):

\[
\overline{P} = \frac{1}{2} \mu v^2 A^2 \omega^2
\]

Finally, recognizing that the factor \(v^2\) in the expression for \(F\) simplifies with the expression for \(\overline{P}\), we arrive at:

\[
\overline{P} = \frac{1}{2} \mu v \omega^2 A^2

Thus, the average rate of energy transmission is:

\[
\boxed{\overline{P} = \frac{1}{2} \mu v \omega^2 A^2}

\section*{Problem}

A fork and a monochord string of length 100 cm give 4 beats per second. The string is made shorter, without any change of tension, until it is in unison with the fork. If its new length is 99 cm, what is the frequency of the fork?

\section*{Solution}

Let \( f_1 \) be the frequency of the fork and \( f_2 \) be the frequency of the string when its length is 100 cm. The beat frequency is given by the absolute difference between the two frequencies:

\[
|f_1 - f_2| = 4 \, \text{Hz}
\]

The frequency of a string is inversely proportional to its length when tension and mass per unit length are constant. Thus, we have:

\[
f_2 \cdot 100 = f_1 \cdot 99
\]

Solving for \( f_2 \):

\[
f_2 = \frac{99}{100} f_1
\]

Substitute \( f_2 \) in the beat frequency equation:

\[
|f_1 - \frac{99}{100} f_1| = 4
\]

Simplify:

\[
|f_1 (1 - \frac{99}{100})| = 4
\]

\[
|f_1 \cdot \frac{1}{100}| = 4
\]

\[
f_1 = 400 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Thus, the frequency of the fork is \( \boxed{400 \, \text{Hz}} \).

To determine the velocity, consider the form \( (2x - t) = \text{constant} \). Rearranging gives:
\[
2x = t + \text{constant}
\]

Differentiating both sides with respect to time \( t \), we get:
\[
2 \frac{dx}{dt} = 1
\]

Thus, the velocity \( v \) of the pulse is:
\[
v = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The positive sign indicates that the pulse is moving in the positive \( x \)-direction.

Next, we determine whether the pulse is symmetric. The function \( y(x, t) \) is symmetric about the line \( 2x = t \) because the expression \( (2x - t)^2 \) is symmetric with respect to \( 2x - t \). Therefore, the pulse is symmetric.

\section*{Conclusion}

The velocity of the pulse is \( \frac{1}{2} \, \text{m/s} \) in the positive \( x \)-direction. The pulse is symmetric about the line \( 2x = t \).

8.25,"To show that the right-hand side of the equation has the units of speed, we need to analyze the units of each component in the expression \( v = \sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}} \), where \( F \) is the tension in the string and \( \mu \) is the linear mass density.

Here is the properly formatted LaTeX code for the explanation:

```latex

\begin{document}

The speed of a wave on a string is given by the equation:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( v \) is the speed of the wave,
    \item \( F \) is the tension in the string (units: Newtons, \( \text{N} \)),
    \item \( \mu \) is the linear mass density of the string (units: kilograms per meter, \( \text{kg/m} \)).
\end{itemize}

To show that the right-hand side of this equation has the units of speed, we analyze the units:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{N}}{\text{kg/m}}}
\]

Recall that 1 Newton is equivalent to 1 kg m/s\(^2\). Therefore, the units become:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{\text{kg m/s}^2}{\text{kg/m}}} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}} = \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\]

Thus, the units of the right-hand side simplify to meters per second, which are indeed the units of speed.

This LaTeX document explains the equation and verifies that the units on the right-hand side are consistent with the units of speed."
8.26,"To show that for a sinusoidal wave traveling along a string, the slope \(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\) at any point \(x\) is equal to the negative of the instantaneous transverse velocity \(\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\) of the string at \(x\) divided by the wave velocity \(v\), we can start with the wave equation for a sinusoidal wave:

\[
y(x, t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t)
\]

where:
- \(A\) is the amplitude of the wave,
- \(k\) is the wave number, \(k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\),
- \(\omega\) is the angular frequency, \(\omega = 2\pi f\),
- \(\lambda\) is the wavelength,
- \(f\) is the frequency.

The partial derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) gives the slope of the wave:

\[
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( A \sin(kx - \omega t) \right) = A k \cos(kx - \omega t)
\]

The partial derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(t\) gives the transverse velocity of the wave:

\[
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( A \sin(kx - \omega t) \right) = -A \omega \cos(kx - \omega t)
\]

The wave velocity \(v\) is related to the wave number and angular frequency by:

\[
v = \frac{\omega}{k}
\]

Now, we can relate the slope and the transverse velocity:

\[
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = A k \cos(kx - \omega t) = -\frac{A \omega}{v} \cos(kx - \omega t) = -\frac{1}{v} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
\]

Thus, we have shown that:

\[
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = -\frac{1}{v} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
\]

This equation demonstrates that the slope of the wave at any point \(x\) is equal to the negative of the transverse velocity at that point divided by the wave velocity \(v\)."

\section*{Wave Equation for Transverse Waves on a Stretched String}

\subsection*{(a) Derivation of the Wave Equation}

Consider a small segment of a string upon which a wave pulse is traveling. The wave equation for transverse waves on a stretched string can be derived by analyzing the forces acting on a differential element of the string.

The transverse displacement of the string is denoted by \( y(x, t) \). The tension in the string is \( F \), and the mass per unit length is \( \mu \).

The wave equation is given by:
\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\mu}{F} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Solution to the Wave Equation}

To show that the wave function \( y(x - vt) \) represents a wave traveling in the positive \( x \)-direction, we substitute it into the wave equation.

Assume the wave function is:
\[
y(x, t) = f(x - vt)
\]

The partial derivatives with respect to \( x \) and \( t \) are:
\[
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = f'(x - vt)
\]
\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = f''(x - vt)
\]
\[
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = -v f'(x - vt)
\]
\[
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = v^2 f''(x - vt)
\]

Substituting these into the wave equation:
\[
f''(x - vt) = \frac{\mu}{F} v^2 f''(x - vt)
\]

For this equation to hold for all \( x \) and \( t \), the terms must be equal, which implies:
\[
1 = \frac{\mu}{F} v^2
\]

Solving for the wave velocity \( v \), we obtain:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}}
\]

This expression shows that the velocity \( v \) of the wave is determined by the tension \( F \) and the mass per unit length \( \mu \).

\title{Physics Problem: Wave Reflection and Transmission at a Boundary}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

Two wires of different densities are joined as in Fig. 8.2. An incident wave 
\[
y_1 = A_1 \sin(\omega t - k_1 x)
\]
is travelling in the positive \(x\)-direction along the wire. At the boundary, this wave is partly transmitted. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Find the reflected and transmitted amplitudes in terms of the incident amplitude.
    \item[(b)] Determine when the amplitude of the reflected wave will be negative.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Reflected and Transmitted Amplitudes}

When a wave encounters a boundary between two media with different densities, part of the wave is reflected and part is transmitted. The incident wave is given by:
\[
y_1 = A_1 \sin(\omega t - k_1 x)
\]

The reflected wave can be expressed as:
\[
y_r = A_r \sin(\omega t + k_1 x)
\]

The transmitted wave can be expressed as:
\[
y_t = A_t \sin(\omega t - k_2 x)
\]

Using boundary conditions at the interface, we can relate the amplitudes:
\[
A_r = \frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1} A_1
\]
\[
A_t = \frac{2Z_2}{Z_2 + Z_1} A_1
\]

where \(Z_1\) and \(Z_2\) are the impedances of the two wires, given by \(Z = \rho v\), with \(\rho\) being the density and \(v\) the wave speed in the medium.

\subsection*{(b) Negative Amplitude of the Reflected Wave}

The amplitude of the reflected wave \(A_r\) will be negative when:
\[
Z_2 < Z_1
\]

This condition implies that the impedance of the second medium is less than that of the first medium, causing a phase inversion upon reflection.

For the wave shown in Fig. 8.3, find its frequency and wavelength if its speed is \( v = 24 \, \text{m/s} \). Write the equation for this wave as it travels along the \( +x \)-axis if its position at \( t = 0 \) is as shown in Fig. 8.3.

\section*{Solution}

Assuming the wave is sinusoidal, the general form of the wave equation traveling along the \( +x \)-axis is given by:

\[
y(x, t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi)
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( A \) is the amplitude of the wave,
    \item \( k \) is the wave number, \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \),
    \item \( \omega \) is the angular frequency, \( \omega = 2\pi f \),
    \item \( \phi \) is the phase constant.
\end{itemize}

Given the wave speed \( v = 24 \, \text{m/s} \), we know:

\[
v = f \lambda
\]

Solving for the frequency \( f \) and wavelength \( \lambda \):

\[
f = \frac{v}{\lambda}
\]

Assuming the wavelength \( \lambda \) is known from Fig. 8.3, substitute to find \( f \).

The equation of the wave at \( t = 0 \) becomes:

\[
y(x, 0) = A \sin(kx + \phi)

Substitute the known values of \( k \), \( \omega \), and \( \phi \) based on the initial conditions shown in Fig. 8.3 to obtain the specific equation for the wave.

(a) A steel bar of density \( \rho = 7860 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) and Young’s modulus \( E = 2 \times 10^{11} \, \text{N/m}^2 \) and of length \( L = 0.25 \, \text{m} \) is rigidly clamped at one end and free to move at the other end. Determine the fundamental frequency of the bar for longitudinal harmonic vibrations.

(b) How do the frequencies compare with 
\begin{itemize}
    \item (i) rod free at both ends;
    \item (ii) bar clamped at the midpoint;
    \item (iii) bar clamped at both ends.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Solution}

(a) The fundamental frequency \( f \) of a bar clamped at one end and free at the other end for longitudinal vibrations is given by:

\[
f = \frac{1}{4L} \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
f = \frac{1}{4 \times 0.25} \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 10^{11}}{7860}}
\]

Calculating the expression:

\[
f = \frac{1}{1} \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 10^{11}}{7860}}
\]

\[
f = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 10^{11}}{7860}} \approx 318.5 \, \text{Hz}
\]

(b) Comparison of frequencies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item (i) For a rod free at both ends, the fundamental frequency is given by:

    \[
    f_{\text{free}} = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}
    \]

    \item (ii) For a bar clamped at the midpoint, it behaves like two bars each of length \( L/2 \) clamped at one end and free at the other, so the fundamental frequency is:

    \[
    f_{\text{midpoint}} = \frac{1}{4(L/2)} \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}} = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}
    \]

    \item (iii) For a bar clamped at both ends, the fundamental frequency is:

    \[
    f_{\text{clamped}} = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}
    \]
\end{itemize}

Thus, the frequency for the bar clamped at one end and free at the other is lower than the frequencies for the other configurations.

8.34,"To show that for \( kl < 0.2 \), the frequency equation for a mass-loaded system reduces to that of a simple harmonic oscillator, we start with the given frequency condition:

\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, \( l \) is the length of the bar, \( M \) is the mass at the end, and \( m \) is the mass per unit length of the bar.

For small values of \( kl \), specifically \( kl < 0.2 \), we can use the approximation for the tangent function:

\[
\tan(kl) \approx kl
\]

Substituting this approximation into the frequency condition, we have:

\[
kl \cdot kl = \frac{M}{m}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
k^2 l^2 = \frac{M}{m}
\]

Solving for \( k \), we find:

\[
k = \frac{1}{l} \sqrt{\frac{M}{m}}
\]

The angular frequency \( \omega \) is related to the wave number \( k \) by the relation:

\[
\omega = v k
\]

where \( v \) is the wave speed. For a simple harmonic oscillator, the angular frequency is given by:

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k_{\text{eff}}}{M_{\text{eff}}}}
\]

where \( k_{\text{eff}} \) is the effective spring constant and \( M_{\text{eff}} \) is the effective mass. Comparing this with our expression for \( \omega \), we see that the system behaves like a simple harmonic oscillator with:

\[
k_{\text{eff}} = \frac{M}{l^2}
\]

Thus, for \( kl < 0.2 \), the frequency equation reduces to that of a simple harmonic oscillator.

where \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \) is the wave number. We want the formula \( v^2 = gh \) to be within 1% of the actual velocity. Let's set up the condition for this:

1. The approximate velocity squared is \( v_{\text{approx}}^2 = gh \).
2. The actual velocity squared is \( v_{\text{actual}}^2 = \frac{g \tanh(kh)}{k} \).

We want:

\[

Substitute the expressions for \( v_{\text{approx}}^2 \) and \( v_{\text{actual}}^2 \):

\[
\left| \frac{gh - \frac{g \tanh(kh)}{k}}{\frac{g \tanh(kh)}{k}} \right| < 0.01

- \( \sigma \) is the surface tension,

- Wavelength, \( \lambda = 3.66 \, \text{mm} = 3.66 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \).

First, calculate the speed of the wave using the relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength:

\[
v = f \lambda = 100 \, \text{Hz} \times 3.66 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} = 0.366 \, \text{m/s}

Assuming the density of water, \( \rho \approx 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), we can rearrange the formula to solve for the surface tension, \( \sigma \):

\[
\sigma = \rho \lambda v^2

Substituting the known values:

\[
\sigma = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 3.66 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \times (0.366 \, \text{m/s})^2

For water, the density \( \rho = 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) and the surface tension \( S = 0.075 \, \text{N/m} \). We need to calculate the phase velocity \( v_p \) and the group velocity \( v_g \) in deep water for small ripples with wavelength \( \lambda = 1 \, \text{cm} \) and for large waves with \( \lambda = 1 \, \text{m} \).

\section*{Solution}

The phase velocity \( v_p \) for deep water waves is given by the formula:
\[
v_p = \sqrt{\frac{g \lambda}{2\pi} + \frac{2\pi S}{\rho \lambda}}
\]

The group velocity \( v_g \) is related to the phase velocity by:
\[
v_g = \frac{d(\omega)}{d(k)}
\]
where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency and \( k \) is the wave number, \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \).

For small ripples with \( \lambda = 1 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} \):
\[
v_p = \sqrt{\frac{g \times 0.01}{2\pi} + \frac{2\pi \times 0.075}{1000 \times 0.01}}

v_p = \sqrt{\frac{g \times 1}{2\pi} + \frac{2\pi \times 0.075}{1000 \times 1}}

The relation for total energy \( E \) and momentum \( p \) for a relativistic particle is given by:

\begin{equation}
    E^2 = c^2 p^2 + m^2 c^4,
\end{equation}

where \( m \) is the rest mass and \( c \) is the velocity of light. Using the relations \( E = \hbar \omega \) and \( p = \hbar k \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency and \( k \) is the wave number, and \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\), with \( h \) being Planck's constant, we can show that the product of group velocity \( v_g \) and the phase velocity \( v_p \) is \( v_p v_g = c^2 \).

Starting with the energy-momentum relation:

\begin{equation}
    (\hbar \omega)^2 = c^2 (\hbar k)^2 + m^2 c^4,
\end{equation}

which simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
    \hbar^2 \omega^2 = c^2 \hbar^2 k^2 + m^2 c^4.
\end{equation}

Dividing the entire equation by \(\hbar^2\), we get:

\begin{equation}
    \omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + \frac{m^2 c^4}{\hbar^2}.
\end{equation}

The phase velocity \( v_p \) is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}.
\end{equation}

The group velocity \( v_g \) is given by:

\begin{equation}
    v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}.
\end{equation}

Differentiating the dispersion relation \(\omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + \frac{m^2 c^4}{\hbar^2}\) with respect to \( k \), we have:

\begin{equation}
    2\omega \frac{d\omega}{dk} = 2c^2 k.
\end{equation}

Solving for \(\frac{d\omega}{dk}\), we find:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\omega}{dk} = \frac{c^2 k}{\omega}.
\end{equation}

Thus, the group velocity is:

\begin{equation}
    v_g = \frac{c^2 k}{\omega}.
\end{equation}

Now, the product of the phase velocity and the group velocity is:

\begin{equation}
    v_p v_g = \left(\frac{\omega}{k}\right) \left(\frac{c^2 k}{\omega}\right) = c^2.
\end{equation}

Therefore, we have shown that:

\begin{equation}
    v_p v_g = c^2.

8.44,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the velocity of surface waves on water, which is influenced by both gravity and surface tension. The formula is given by:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{g \lambda}{2\pi} + \frac{2\pi \gamma}{\rho \lambda}}
\]

where:
- \( v \) is the velocity of the wave,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\(9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\)),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength,
- \( \gamma \) is the surface tension,
- \( \rho \) is the density of the liquid.

Given:
- \( v = 0.3 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \gamma = 0.075 \, \text{N/m} \),
- \( \rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \).

We need to find the wavelength \(\lambda\). Rearranging the formula to solve for \(\lambda\), we have:

\[
v^2 = \frac{g \lambda}{2\pi} + \frac{2\pi \gamma}{\rho \lambda}
\]

Multiplying through by \(\lambda\) to clear the fraction:

\[
v^2 \lambda = \frac{g \lambda^2}{2\pi} + \frac{2\pi \gamma}{\rho}
\]

Rearranging gives a quadratic equation in terms of \(\lambda\):

\[
\frac{g}{2\pi} \lambda^2 - v^2 \lambda + \frac{2\pi \gamma}{\rho} = 0
\]

This is a standard quadratic equation of the form \(a\lambda^2 + b\lambda + c = 0\), where:

- \( a = \frac{g}{2\pi} \),
- \( b = -v^2 \),
- \( c = \frac{2\pi \gamma}{\rho} \).

The solution for \(\lambda\) is given by the quadratic formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
a = \frac{9.81}{2\pi}, \quad b = -(0.3)^2, \quad c = \frac{2\pi \times 0.075}{1000}
\]

\[
\lambda = \frac{0.09 \pm \sqrt{(0.09)^2 - 4 \times \frac{9.81}{2\pi} \times \frac{2\pi \times 0.075}{1000}}}{2 \times \frac{9.81}{2\pi}}
\]

Calculate the discriminant and solve for \(\lambda\):

\[
\lambda = \frac{0.09 \pm \sqrt{0.0081 - 4 \times \frac{9.81 \times 0.075}{1000}}}{\frac{9.81}{\pi}}
\]

Finally, evaluate the expression to find the wavelength \(\lambda\).

For determining the surface tension by means of ripples, shorter wavelengths (higher frequency waves) are preferable, as they are more sensitive to changes in surface tension."

\section*{Problem}

Waves in deep water travel with phase velocity given by $v_p^2 = \frac{g}{k}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $k$ is the wave number, $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$. Obtain an expression for the group velocity and show that it is equal to $v_p/2$. [University of Manchester 2006]

\section*{Solution}

The phase velocity $v_p$ is given by:
\[
v_p = \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}
\]

The group velocity $v_g$ is defined as:
\[
v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}
\]

For deep water waves, the dispersion relation is:
\[
\omega^2 = gk
\]

Taking the derivative with respect to $k$, we have:
\[
2\omega \frac{d\omega}{dk} = g
\]

Solving for $\frac{d\omega}{dk}$, we get:
\[
\frac{d\omega}{dk} = \frac{g}{2\omega}
\]

Since $\omega = v_p k = \sqrt{gk} \cdot k$, we substitute $\omega = \sqrt{gk}$:
\[
\frac{d\omega}{dk} = \frac{g}{2\sqrt{gk}}
\]

Simplifying, we find:
\[
v_g = \frac{\sqrt{gk}}{2} = \frac{v_p}{2}
\]

Thus, the group velocity $v_g$ is indeed equal to half of the phase velocity $v_p$:
\[
v_g = \frac{v_p}{2}
\]

To show that the phase velocity is minimum at \( \lambda = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{S \rho}{g}} \), we start by expressing the wave number \( k \) in terms of the wavelength \( \lambda \):

\[
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}

Substituting \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \) into the expression for \( v_p^2 \), we have:

\[
v_p^2 = \frac{g \lambda}{2\pi} + \frac{S (2\pi)}{\rho \lambda}

To find the minimum phase velocity, we take the derivative of \( v_p^2 \) with respect to \( \lambda \) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{d}{d\lambda}\left( \frac{g \lambda}{2\pi} + \frac{S (2\pi)}{\rho \lambda} \right) = \frac{g}{2\pi} - \frac{S (2\pi)}{\rho \lambda^2} = 0

Solving for \( \lambda \), we get:

\[
\frac{g}{2\pi} = \frac{S (2\pi)}{\rho \lambda^2}

\[
g \lambda^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 S}{\rho}

\[
\lambda^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 S}{g \rho}

\[
\lambda = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{S \rho}{g}}

\section*{Harmonic Variation of Displacement and Pressure in a Plane Wave}

Let the displacement \( s(x, t) \) and pressure \( p(x, t) \) of a plane wave vary harmonically. We can express them as:

\begin{align}
    s(x, t) &= s_0 \cos(kx - \omega t + \phi_s), \\
    p(x, t) &= p_0 \cos(kx - \omega t + \phi_p),
\end{align}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( s_0 \) is the displacement amplitude,
    \item \( p_0 \) is the pressure amplitude,
    \item \( k \) is the wave number,
    \item \( \omega \) is the angular frequency,
    \item \( \phi_s \) and \( \phi_p \) are the phase constants for displacement and pressure, respectively.
\end{itemize}

The pressure \( p(x, t) \) in a plane wave is related to the displacement \( s(x, t) \) by the equation of motion and the adiabatic relation between pressure and density. For a plane wave traveling in a medium, the pressure is given by:

\begin{equation}
    p(x, t) = -B \frac{\partial s(x, t)}{\partial x},
\end{equation}

where \( B \) is the bulk modulus of the medium.

Substituting the expression for \( s(x, t) \) into the pressure equation, we have:

\begin{align}
    p(x, t) &= -B \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[ s_0 \cos(kx - \omega t + \phi_s) \right] \\
    &= -B \left[ -s_0 k \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi_s) \right] \\
    &= B s_0 k \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi_s).
\end{align}

Recognizing that \( \sin(\theta) = \cos(\theta - \frac{\pi}{2}) \), we can rewrite the pressure as:

\begin{equation}
    p(x, t) = B s_0 k \cos(kx - \omega t + \phi_s - \frac{\pi}{2}).
\end{equation}

Comparing with the expression for \( p(x, t) \), we see:

\begin{equation}
    \phi_p = \phi_s - \frac{\pi}{2}.
\end{equation}

This shows that the displacement is 90° out of phase with the pressure wave.

Finally, equating the amplitudes from the harmonic expressions, we have:

\begin{equation}
    p_0 = B s_0 k.
\end{equation}

Thus, the relationship between the pressure amplitude and the displacement amplitude is given by:

\begin{equation}
    s_0 = \frac{p_0}{B k}.

Assuming $\rho = 1.29 \, \text{kg/m}^3$ for the density of air and $v = 331 \, \text{m/s}$ for the speed of sound, find the pressure amplitude corresponding to the threshold of hearing intensity of $10^{-12} \, \text{W/m}^2$.

\section*{Solution}

The intensity $I$ of a sound wave is related to the pressure amplitude $p_0$ by the equation:

\[
I = \frac{p_0^2}{2 \rho v}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $I = 10^{-12} \, \text{W/m}^2$ is the intensity at the threshold of hearing,

    \item $v = 331 \, \text{m/s}$ is the speed of sound.
\end{itemize}

Rearranging the formula to solve for the pressure amplitude $p_0$, we have:

\[
p_0 = \sqrt{2 \rho v I}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
p_0 = \sqrt{2 \times 1.29 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 331 \, \text{m/s} \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/m}^2}

Calculating the above expression:

\[
p_0 = \sqrt{2 \times 1.29 \times 331 \times 10^{-12}}

\[
p_0 \approx \sqrt{8.538 \times 10^{-10}}

A small source of sound radiates energy uniformly at a rate of 4 W. Calculate the intensity and the intensity level at a point 25 cm from the source if there is no absorption.

\section*{Solution}

The intensity \( I \) of sound at a distance \( r \) from a point source is given by the formula:

\[
I = \frac{P}{A}
\]

where \( P \) is the power of the source and \( A \) is the surface area over which the power is distributed. For a point source radiating uniformly in all directions, the surface area \( A \) is the surface area of a sphere with radius \( r \):

\[
A = 4\pi r^2
\]

Given that the power \( P = 4 \, \text{W} \) and the distance \( r = 25 \, \text{cm} = 0.25 \, \text{m} \), we can substitute these values into the equation for intensity:

\[
I = \frac{4 \, \text{W}}{4\pi (0.25 \, \text{m})^2} = \frac{4}{4\pi \times 0.0625} = \frac{4}{0.25\pi} = \frac{16}{\pi} \, \text{W/m}^2
\]

Next, we calculate the intensity level \( L \) in decibels (dB) using the formula:

\[
L = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{I}{I_0} \right)
\]

where \( I_0 = 1 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/m}^2 \) is the reference intensity. Substituting the calculated intensity:

\[
L = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{16/\pi}{1 \times 10^{-12}} \right)
\]

\[
L = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{16}{\pi} \times 10^{12} \right)
\]

\[
L \approx 10 \left( \log_{10}(16) - \log_{10}(\pi) + 12 \right)

\[
L \approx 10 \left( 1.2041 - 0.4971 + 12 \right)

\[
L \approx 10 \times 12.707 = 127.07 \, \text{dB}

Thus, the intensity at a point 25 cm from the source is \( \frac{16}{\pi} \, \text{W/m}^2 \) and the intensity level is approximately 127.07 dB.

8.53,"To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between the intensity \( I \) of a sound wave and its pressure amplitude \( p_0 \). The intensity is given by:

\[
I = \frac{p_0^2}{2 \rho v}
\]

where \( \rho \) is the density of the medium and \( v \) is the speed of sound in the medium.

Given:
- Density of air, \( \rho_{\text{air}} = 1.293 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)
- Speed of sound in air, \( v_{\text{air}} = 330 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Speed of sound in water, \( v_{\text{water}} = 1450 \, \text{m/s} \)

Assuming the density of water is approximately \( \rho_{\text{water}} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) (a common approximation), we need to find the ratio of the intensities of the waves in air and water.

Since the pressure amplitudes \( p_0 \) are equal for both waves, the ratio of the intensities \( \frac{I_{\text{air}}}{I_{\text{water}}} \) is:

\[
\frac{I_{\text{air}}}{I_{\text{water}}} = \frac{\frac{p_0^2}{2 \rho_{\text{air}} v_{\text{air}}}}{\frac{p_0^2}{2 \rho_{\text{water}} v_{\text{water}}}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{water}} v_{\text{water}}}{\rho_{\text{air}} v_{\text{air}}}

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{I_{\text{air}}}{I_{\text{water}}} = \frac{1000 \times 1450}{1.293 \times 330}
\]

Calculating the above expression:

\[
\frac{I_{\text{air}}}{I_{\text{water}}} = \frac{1450000}{426.69} \approx 3398.4
\]

Thus, the ratio of the intensities of the waves in air and water is approximately 3398.4. The intensity of the sound wave in water is much greater than that in air due to the higher density and speed of sound in water."

\section*{Problem}

The density of oxygen is 16 times that of hydrogen. For both gases, the adiabatic index $\gamma = 1.4$. If the speed of sound is 317 m/s in oxygen at $0^\circ$C, what is the speed in hydrogen at the same pressure?

\section*{Solution}

The speed of sound \( v \) in a gas is given by the formula:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \gamma \) is the adiabatic index,
    \item \( R \) is the universal gas constant,
    \item \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin,
    \item \( M \) is the molar mass of the gas.
\end{itemize}

Given:
\[
v_{\text{oxygen}} = 317 \, \text{m/s}
\]
\[
\gamma = 1.4
\]
\[
\rho_{\text{oxygen}} = 16 \rho_{\text{hydrogen}}
\]

Since the speed of sound is also given by:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho}}
\]
where \( P \) is the pressure and \( \rho \) is the density, we can equate the expressions for speed of sound in both gases at the same pressure.

For oxygen:
\[
v_{\text{oxygen}} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho_{\text{oxygen}}}}
\]

For hydrogen:
\[
v_{\text{hydrogen}} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho_{\text{hydrogen}}}}
\]

Since \(\rho_{\text{oxygen}} = 16 \rho_{\text{hydrogen}}\), we have:
\[
v_{\text{oxygen}} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{16 \rho_{\text{hydrogen}}}}
\]

Thus, the speed of sound in hydrogen is:
\[
v_{\text{hydrogen}} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho_{\text{hydrogen}}}} = \sqrt{16} \times v_{\text{oxygen}}
\]

Calculating \( v_{\text{hydrogen}} \):
\[
v_{\text{hydrogen}} = 4 \times 317 \, \text{m/s} = 1268 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Therefore, the speed of sound in hydrogen at the same pressure is \( 1268 \, \text{m/s} \).

8.61,"To determine how many decibels one sound wave is louder than the other, we use the formula for sound intensity level in decibels:

\[
L = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{I}{I_0} \right)
\]

where \( L \) is the sound intensity level in decibels, \( I \) is the intensity of the sound wave, and \( I_0 \) is the reference intensity, typically \( 10^{-12} \, \text{W/m}^2 \).

Let's calculate the decibel levels for each intensity and then find the difference.

1. For the first sound wave with intensity \( I_1 = 0.4 \, \text{W/m}^2 \):

\[
L_1 = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{0.4}{10^{-12}} \right)

2. For the second sound wave with intensity \( I_2 = 10 \, \text{W/m}^2 \):

\[
L_2 = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{10}{10^{-12}} \right)
\]

The difference in decibels between the two sound waves is:

\[
\Delta L = L_2 - L_1 = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{I_2}{I_0} \right) - 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{I_1}{I_0} \right)
\]

Using the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta L = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{I_2}{I_1} \right)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\Delta L = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{10}{0.4} \right)
\]

\[
\Delta L = 10 \log_{10} (25)
\]

Finally, calculate the numerical value:

\[
\Delta L \approx 10 \times 1.398 = 13.98 \, \text{dB}

Thus, the second sound wave is approximately \( 13.98 \) decibels louder than the first."
8.62,"To find the ratio of the intensities of two sounds when one sound is 6.0 dB higher than the other, we can use the formula for the difference in sound levels in decibels:

\]

where:
- \(\Delta L\) is the difference in sound levels in decibels,
- \(I_2\) is the intensity of the louder sound,
- \(I_1\) is the intensity of the quieter sound.

Given that \(\Delta L = 6.0 \, \text{dB}\), we can solve for the ratio \(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\):

\[
6.0 = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{I_2}{I_1} \right)
\]

Divide both sides by 10:

\[
0.6 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{I_2}{I_1} \right)
\]

To solve for \(\frac{I_2}{I_1}\), we exponentiate both sides using base 10:

\[
\frac{I_2}{I_1} = 10^{0.6}
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{I_2}{I_1} \approx 3.981

\title{Sound Wave Properties in Air and Water}
\author{}

\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

One sound wave travels in air and the other in water, their intensities and frequencies being equal. Calculate the ratio of their (a) wavelengths, (b) pressure amplitudes, and (c) amplitudes of vibration of particles in air and water. Assume that the density of air is \(\rho_{\text{air}} = \SI{1.293}{\kilogram\per\meter\cubed}\), and the sound velocities in air and water are \(v_{\text{air}} = \SI{331}{\meter\per\second}\) and \(v_{\text{water}} = \SI{1450}{\meter\per\second}\), respectively.

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Ratio of Wavelengths}

The wavelength \(\lambda\) of a sound wave is given by the relation:
\[
\lambda = \frac{v}{f}
\]
where \(v\) is the velocity of sound and \(f\) is the frequency. Given that the frequencies are equal, the ratio of the wavelengths in air and water is:
\[
\frac{\lambda_{\text{air}}}{\lambda_{\text{water}}} = \frac{v_{\text{air}}}{v_{\text{water}}} = \frac{\SI{331}{\meter\per\second}}{\SI{1450}{\meter\per\second}}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Ratio of Pressure Amplitudes}

The intensity \(I\) of a sound wave is related to the pressure amplitude \(p_0\) by:
\[
I = \frac{p_0^2}{2 \rho v}
\]
Given that the intensities are equal, we have:
\[
\frac{p_{0,\text{air}}^2}{2 \rho_{\text{air}} v_{\text{air}}} = \frac{p_{0,\text{water}}^2}{2 \rho_{\text{water}} v_{\text{water}}}
\]
Solving for the ratio of pressure amplitudes:
\[
\frac{p_{0,\text{air}}}{p_{0,\text{water}}} = \sqrt{\frac{\rho_{\text{air}} v_{\text{air}}}{\rho_{\text{water}} v_{\text{water}}}}
\]

\subsection*{(c) Ratio of Amplitudes of Vibration}

The amplitude of vibration \(A\) is related to the pressure amplitude by:
\[
p_0 = \rho v \omega A
\]
where \(\omega = 2\pi f\) is the angular frequency. Thus, the ratio of the amplitudes of vibration is:
\[
\frac{A_{\text{air}}}{A_{\text{water}}} = \frac{p_{0,\text{air}}}{p_{0,\text{water}}} \cdot \frac{\rho_{\text{water}} v_{\text{water}}}{\rho_{\text{air}} v_{\text{air}}}

8.67,"To show that the characteristic impedance \(\rho v\) of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its absolute temperature \(T\), we start by considering the relationship between the speed of sound \(v\) in a gas and its temperature. The speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}
\]

where:
- \(\gamma\) is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats),
- \(R\) is the universal gas constant,
- \(T\) is the absolute temperature,
- \(M\) is the molar mass of the gas.

The characteristic impedance \(\rho v\) is defined as the product of the density \(\rho\) of the gas and the speed of sound \(v\). The density \(\rho\) of an ideal gas can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{P M}{R T}
\]

where \(P\) is the pressure of the gas. Substituting the expressions for \(\rho\) and \(v\) into the characteristic impedance, we have:

\[
\rho v = \left(\frac{P M}{R T}\right) \left(\sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}\right)
\]

Simplifying this expression, we find:

\[
\rho v = \frac{P M}{R T} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}} = \frac{P}{\sqrt{R T}} \cdot \sqrt{\gamma M}
\]

Thus, the characteristic impedance \(\rho v\) is inversely proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature \(T\):

\[
\rho v \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}
\]

Now, let's calculate the characteristic impedance at specific temperatures:

### (a) At \(0^\circ \text{C}\):

Convert \(0^\circ \text{C}\) to Kelvin:

\[
T = 0 + 273.15 = 273.15 \, \text{K}
\]

The characteristic impedance at \(0^\circ \text{C}\) is:

\[
\rho v \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{273.15}}
\]

### (b) At \(80^\circ \text{C}\):

Convert \(80^\circ \text{C}\) to Kelvin:

\[
T = 80 + 273.15 = 353.15 \, \text{K}
\]

The characteristic impedance at \(80^\circ \text{C}\) is:

\[
\rho v \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{353.15}}
\]

In conclusion, the characteristic impedance decreases as the temperature increases, confirming the inverse proportionality to the square root of the absolute temperature."

8.69,"To derive Laplace's formula for the sound velocity in a gas, we start by considering the adiabatic process that occurs when sound waves propagate through a gas. The sound velocity \( v \) in a gas is related to the adiabatic bulk modulus \( K_s \) and the density \( \rho \) of the gas. The relationship is given by:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{K_s}{\rho}}
\]

For an ideal gas undergoing an adiabatic process, the adiabatic bulk modulus \( K_s \) can be expressed in terms of the pressure \( P \) and the adiabatic index \( \gamma \) (ratio of specific heats, \( C_p/C_v \)):

\[
K_s = \gamma P
\]

Substituting this into the expression for the sound velocity, we have:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho}}

Using the ideal gas law, \( P = \rho R T \), where \( R \) is the specific gas constant and \( T \) is the absolute temperature, we can substitute for \( P \):

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma \rho R T}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\gamma R T}
\]

Thus, Laplace's formula for the sound velocity in a gas is:

\[
v = \sqrt{\gamma R T}

8.71,"To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect for sound waves. The Doppler effect describes the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the source of the wave.

Given:
- Speed of the train, \( v_s = 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \) (conversion from km/h to m/s)
- Speed of sound in air, \( v = 343 \, \text{m/s} \) (assuming standard conditions)

We need to find the ratio of the relative frequencies of the reflected and direct sounds as heard by the driver.

### Direct Sound Frequency

The frequency of the sound heard directly by the driver is given by the Doppler effect formula:

\[
f' = f \left( \frac{v}{v - v_s} \right)
\]

where:
- \( f' \) is the frequency heard by the observer (driver),
- \( f \) is the frequency of the source (whistle),
- \( v \) is the speed of sound,
- \( v_s \) is the speed of the source (train).

### Reflected Sound Frequency

For the reflected sound, the wall acts as a stationary observer first, reflecting the sound back to the moving driver. The frequency heard by the wall is:

\[
f_{\text{wall}} = f \left( \frac{v}{v - v_s} \right)
\]

This frequency is then reflected back to the driver, who is moving towards the source of the reflected sound. The frequency of the reflected sound heard by the driver is:

\[
f'' = f_{\text{wall}} \left( \frac{v + v_s}{v} \right) = f \left( \frac{v}{v - v_s} \right) \left( \frac{v + v_s}{v} \right)
\]

### Ratio of Frequencies

The ratio of the frequencies of the reflected sound to the direct sound is:

\[
\frac{f''}{f'} = \frac{f \left( \frac{v}{v - v_s} \right) \left( \frac{v + v_s}{v} \right)}{f \left( \frac{v}{v - v_s} \right)} = \frac{v + v_s}{v}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{f''}{f'} = \frac{343 + 20}{343} = \frac{363}{343} \approx 1.0584
\]

Thus, the ratio of the relative frequencies of the reflected and direct sounds as heard by the driver is approximately \( 1.0584 \).

\[
\boxed{1.0584}

8.72,"To solve this problem, we will use the Doppler effect formula for sound. When both the source and the observer are moving towards each other, the observed frequency \( f' \) is given by:

\[

\]

where:
- \( f \) is the emitted frequency of the source (520 Hz),
- \( v \) is the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 m/s at 20°C),
- \( v_o \) is the speed of the observer (converted from 90 km/h to m/s),
- \( v_s \) is the speed of the source (also converted from 90 km/h to m/s).

First, convert the speed from km/h to m/s:

\[
v_o = v_s = 90 \, \text{km/h} \times \frac{1000 \, \text{m/km}}{3600 \, \text{s/h}} = 25 \, \text{m/s}

Now, substitute the values into the Doppler effect formula:

\[
f' = 520 \, \text{Hz} \times \frac{343 \, \text{m/s} + 25 \, \text{m/s}}{343 \, \text{m/s} - 25 \, \text{m/s}}

\[

\section*{Problem}

Two trains move towards each other at a speed of 90 km/h relative to the earth's surface. One gives a 520 Hz signal. Find the frequency heard by the observer on the other train.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we will use the Doppler effect formula for sound. When both the source and the observer are moving towards each other, the observed frequency \( f' \) is given by:

\[
f' = f \frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( f \) is the emitted frequency of the source (520 Hz),
    \item \( v \) is the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 m/s at 20°C),
    \item \( v_o \) is the speed of the observer (converted from 90 km/h to m/s),
    \item \( v_s \) is the speed of the source (also converted from 90 km/h to m/s).
\end{itemize}

First, convert the speed from km/h to m/s:

\[
v_o = v_s = 90 \, \text{km/h} \times \frac{1000 \, \text{m/km}}{3600 \, \text{s/h}} = 25 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Now, substitute the values into the Doppler effect formula:

\[
f' = 520 \, \text{Hz} \times \frac{343 \, \text{m/s} + 25 \, \text{m/s}}{343 \, \text{m/s} - 25 \, \text{m/s}}
\]

Calculate the observed frequency:

\[
f' = 520 \, \text{Hz} \times \frac{368 \, \text{m/s}}{318 \, \text{m/s}}
\]

\[
f' \approx 520 \, \text{Hz} \times 1.157
\]

\[
f' \approx 601.64 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Thus, the frequency heard by the observer on the other train is approximately \( 601.64 \, \text{Hz} \).

\section*{Problem}

Two trains move away from each other at a speed of 25 m/s relative to the earth's surface. One gives a 520 Hz signal. Find the frequency heard by the observer on the other train (sound velocity = 330 m/s).

\section*{Solution}

To find the frequency heard by the observer on the other train, we use the Doppler effect formula for sound:

\[
f' = f \frac{v + v_o}{v + v_s}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( f' \) is the observed frequency,
    \item \( f = 520 \, \text{Hz} \) is the source frequency,
    \item \( v = 330 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of sound in air,
    \item \( v_o = 25 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of the observer (the second train),
    \item \( v_s = 25 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of the source (the first train).
\end{itemize}

Since the trains are moving away from each other, the observer perceives a lower frequency. Thus, the formula becomes:

\[
f' = 520 \, \text{Hz} \times \frac{330 \, \text{m/s} + 25 \, \text{m/s}}{330 \, \text{m/s} + 25 \, \text{m/s}}
\]

Simplifying the expression:

\[
f' = 520 \, \text{Hz} \times \frac{330 + 25}{330 + 25} = 520 \, \text{Hz} \times \frac{355}{355}
\]

\[
f' = 520 \, \text{Hz} \times 1 = 520 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Therefore, the frequency heard by the observer on the other train is \( f' = 520 \, \text{Hz} \).

\section*{Problem}

A whistle of frequency \( f_0 = 540 \, \text{Hz} \) rotates in a circle of radius \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \) at an angular speed of \( \omega = 15.0 \, \text{rad/s} \). What are the maximum and minimum frequencies heard by a listener, standing at a long distance away at rest from the center of the circle? Assume the speed of sound is \( v = 330 \, \text{m/s} \).

\section*{Solution}

The frequency heard by the listener is affected by the Doppler effect. The maximum and minimum frequencies occur when the velocity of the whistle is directly towards or away from the listener.

The linear speed \( v_s \) of the whistle is given by:
\[
v_s = \omega \cdot r = 15.0 \, \text{rad/s} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 30 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Using the Doppler effect formula, the observed frequency \( f \) is:
\[
f = f_0 \frac{v}{v \mp v_s}
\]

- For the maximum frequency (\( f_{\text{max}} \)), the whistle moves towards the listener:
  \[
  f_{\text{max}} = f_0 \frac{v}{v - v_s} = 540 \, \text{Hz} \times \frac{330 \, \text{m/s}}{330 \, \text{m/s} - 30 \, \text{m/s}}
  \]
  \[
  f_{\text{max}} = 540 \, \text{Hz} \times \frac{330}{300} = 594 \, \text{Hz}
  \]

- For the minimum frequency (\( f_{\text{min}} \)), the whistle moves away from the listener:
  \[
  f_{\text{min}} = f_0 \frac{v}{v + v_s} = 540 \, \text{Hz} \times \frac{330 \, \text{m/s}}{330 \, \text{m/s} + 30 \, \text{m/s}}
  \]
  \[
  f_{\text{min}} = 540 \, \text{Hz} \times \frac{330}{360} = 495 \, \text{Hz}

Thus, the maximum frequency heard by the listener is \( 594 \, \text{Hz} \) and the minimum frequency is \( 495 \, \text{Hz} \).

\section*{Kundt's Tube Experiment}

In the Kundt’s tube experiment, the length of the steel rod which is stroked is 120 cm long, and the distance between heaps of cork dust is 8 cm when the rod is caused to vibrate longitudinally in air. If the ends of the tube are sealed and the air is replaced by a gas, and the experiment is repeated, the distance between heaps is observed to be 10 cm.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] \textbf{Velocity of sound in the gas:}

    Let \( v_{\text{air}} = 340 \, \text{m/s} \) be the velocity of sound in air. The wavelength of sound in air is given by the distance between two consecutive heaps of cork dust, which is 8 cm or 0.08 m.

    The frequency of the sound in air is:
    \[
    f = \frac{v_{\text{air}}}{\lambda_{\text{air}}} = \frac{340}{0.08} \, \text{Hz}
    \]

    When the air is replaced by the gas, the distance between heaps is 10 cm or 0.10 m. Assuming the frequency remains the same, the velocity of sound in the gas \( v_{\text{gas}} \) is given by:
    \[
    v_{\text{gas}} = f \times \lambda_{\text{gas}} = \frac{340}{0.08} \times 0.10
    \]
    \[
    v_{\text{gas}} = 425 \, \text{m/s}
    \]

    \item[(b)] \textbf{Velocity of sound in the rod:}

    The rod is 120 cm or 1.2 m long, and it vibrates in its fundamental mode. In this mode, the rod has two nodes at the ends and an antinode in the middle, making the rod length half of the wavelength of the sound in the rod.

    Therefore, the wavelength in the rod \( \lambda_{\text{rod}} \) is:
    \[
    \lambda_{\text{rod}} = 2 \times 1.2 = 2.4 \, \text{m}
    \]

    The frequency of the sound in the rod is the same as in air, so:

    \item[(a)] \textbf{What is a shock wave?}
    
    A shock wave is a type of propagating disturbance that moves faster than the local speed of sound in the medium. It is characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in pressure, temperature, and density of the medium. Shock waves are often associated with supersonic flight, explosions, and other phenomena involving rapid energy release.

    The Mach number (\(M\)) is defined as the ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium. If a plane travels at twice the speed of sound, the Mach number is given by:
    \[
    M = \frac{v}{v_s} = \frac{2v_s}{v_s} = 2

\[
T = \frac{0.161 V}{A}
\]

where \( T \) is the reverberation time in seconds, \( V \) is the volume of the room in cubic meters, and \( A \) is the total absorption in sabins.

First, we calculate the volume \( V \) of the room:

\[
V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 10 \, \text{m} \times 18 \, \text{m} \times 4 \, \text{m} = 720 \, \text{m}^3
\]

Next, we calculate the total absorption \( A \). The total absorption is the sum of the absorption of each surface and the absorption by the people in the room.

The absorption \( A \) is given by:

\[
A = \sum (S_i \cdot \alpha_i) + N \cdot \alpha_{\text{person}}
\]

where \( S_i \) is the area of each surface, \( \alpha_i \) is the absorption coefficient of each surface, \( N \) is the number of people, and \( \alpha_{\text{person}} \) is the absorption per person.

Calculate the area of each surface:

- Ceiling and floor area: 
  \[
  S_{\text{ceiling/floor}} = \text{width} \times \text{length} = 10 \, \text{m} \times 18 \, \text{m} = 180 \, \text{m}^2
  \]

- Wall area (two pairs of opposite walls):
  \[
  S_{\text{walls}} = 2 \times (\text{width} \times \text{height} + \text{length} \times \text{height}) = 2 \times (10 \, \text{m} \times 4 \, \text{m} + 18 \, \text{m} \times 4 \, \text{m}) = 2 \times (40 \, \text{m}^2 + 72 \, \text{m}^2) = 224 \, \text{m}^2
  \]

Now, calculate the total absorption \( A \):

\[
A = (S_{\text{ceiling}} \cdot \alpha_{\text{ceiling}}) + (S_{\text{floor}} \cdot \alpha_{\text{floor}}) + (S_{\text{walls}} \cdot \alpha_{\text{walls}}) + N \cdot \alpha_{\text{person}}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
A = (180 \, \text{m}^2 \times 0.60) + (180 \, \text{m}^2 \times 0.02) + (224 \, \text{m}^2 \times 0.03) + 50 \times 0.5
\]

Calculate each term:

\[
A = (108) + (3.6) + (6.72) + 25 = 143.32 \, \text{sabins}
\]

Finally, calculate the reverberation time \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{0.161 \times 720}{143.32} \approx 0.81 \, \text{seconds}

Thus, the reverberation time of the room is approximately \( 0.81 \) seconds."
8.79,"To solve this problem, we need to consider the relationship between the drumming rate, the distance to the mountain, and the speed of sound. Let's denote:

- \( d \) as the initial distance between the man and the mountain.
- \( v \) as the velocity of sound.

Given:

1. The echo is not heard distinctly when the drumming rate is 40 beats per minute.
2. The man moves 90 meters closer, and the echo is again not heard distinctly when the rate is 60 beats per minute.

The condition for the echo not being heard distinctly is that the time interval between beats matches the time taken for the sound to travel to the mountain and back. 

### Solution

**(a) Calculate the initial distance \( d \):**

1. **Initial Position:**

   When the rate is 40 beats per minute, the time interval between beats is:
   \[
   T_1 = \frac{60}{40} = 1.5 \text{ seconds}
   \]

   The time for the sound to travel to the mountain and back is:
   \[
   2d = v \times T_1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d = \frac{v \times 1.5}{2}
   \]

2. **After Moving 90 m Closer:**

   When the rate is 60 beats per minute, the time interval between beats is:
   \[
   T_2 = \frac{60}{60} = 1 \text{ second}
   \]

   The new distance to the mountain is \( d - 90 \) meters, so:
   \[
   2(d - 90) = v \times T_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d - 90 = \frac{v \times 1}{2}
   \]

**Equating the two expressions for \( d \):**

From the first condition:
\[
d = \frac{1.5v}{2}
\]

From the second condition:
\[
d - 90 = \frac{v}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad d = \frac{v}{2} + 90
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( d \):
\[
\frac{1.5v}{2} = \frac{v}{2} + 90
\]

Solving for \( v \):
\[
\frac{1.5v}{2} - \frac{v}{2} = 90 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{0.5v}{2} = 90 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0.25v = 90 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = 360 \text{ m/s}
\]

Substitute \( v = 360 \) m/s back into the equation for \( d \):
\[
d = \frac{1.5 \times 360}{2} = 270 \text{ meters}
\]

**(b) Velocity of sound \( v \):**

From the calculations above, the velocity of sound is \( v = 360 \text{ m/s} \).

### Final Answer

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{(a) Initial distance } d &= 270 \text{ meters} \\
\text{(b) Velocity of sound } v &= 360 \text{ m/s}

\title{Physics Problem: Echoes in a Valley}
\author{Indian Institute of Technology 1973}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

A rifle is fired in a valley formed between two parallel mountains. The echo from one mountain is heard 2 seconds after the first one. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] What is the width of the valley?
    \item[(b)] Is it possible to hear the subsequent echoes from the two mountains simultaneously, at the same point? If so, after what time, given the sound velocity \( v = 360 \, \text{m/s} \).
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Width of the Valley}

Let the width of the valley be \( d \). The time taken for the sound to travel to one mountain and back is \( t_1 \), and for the other mountain is \( t_2 = t_1 + 2 \, \text{s} \).

The speed of sound is given as \( v = 360 \, \text{m/s} \).

For the first mountain:
\[
t_1 = \frac{2d}{v}
\]

For the second mountain:
\[
t_2 = \frac{2d}{v} + 2
\]

Since \( t_2 = t_1 + 2 \), we have:
\[
t_2 - t_1 = 2 \implies \frac{2d}{v} + 2 - \frac{2d}{v} = 2
\]

Thus, the width of the valley is:
\[
d = \frac{v \times 2}{2} = 360 \, \text{m}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Simultaneous Echoes}

For the echoes to be heard simultaneously, the time difference between the echoes must be a multiple of the time it takes for sound to travel back and forth between the mountains.

Let \( n \) be the number of round trips the sound makes between the mountains. The condition for simultaneous echoes is:
\[
n \times \frac{2d}{v} = t_2 - t_1
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
n \times \frac{2 \times 360}{360} = 2
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
n \times 2 = 2 \implies n = 1
\]

Thus, it is possible to hear the subsequent echoes simultaneously after \( n \times \frac{2d}{v} = 2 \, \text{s} \).

\section*{Problem}

Two whistles are sounded with frequencies of 548 and 552 cycles/s, respectively. A man directly in the line between them walks towards the lower-pitched whistle at 1.5 m/s. Find the beat frequency that he hears. Assume the sound velocity of 330 m/s.

\section*{Solution}

To find the beat frequency heard by the man, we need to calculate the frequencies perceived by him due to the Doppler effect. The formula for the observed frequency \( f' \) when the source is stationary and the observer is moving towards the source is given by:

\[
f' = f \left( \frac{v + v_o}{v} \right)
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( f \) is the source frequency,
    \item \( v \) is the speed of sound in air (330 m/s),
    \item \( v_o \) is the speed of the observer (1.5 m/s).
\end{itemize}

First, calculate the frequency heard from the lower-pitched whistle (548 Hz):

\[
f'_1 = 548 \left( \frac{330 + 1.5}{330} \right) = 548 \left( \frac{331.5}{330} \right)
\]

\[
f'_1 \approx 550.49 \text{ Hz}
\]

Next, calculate the frequency heard from the higher-pitched whistle (552 Hz):

\[
f'_2 = 552 \left( \frac{330 - 1.5}{330} \right) = 552 \left( \frac{328.5}{330} \right)
\]

\[
f'_2 \approx 549.49 \text{ Hz}
\]

The beat frequency \( f_b \) is the absolute difference between these two frequencies:

\[
f_b = |f'_1 - f'_2| = |550.49 - 549.49|
\]

\[
f_b = 1 \text{ Hz}
\]

Thus, the beat frequency heard by the man is \(\boxed{1 \text{ Hz}}\).

8.82,"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of beats and the effect of loading on the frequency of tuning forks. Let's denote the frequency of the known fork as \( f_1 = 300 \, \text{Hz} \) and the frequency of the unknown fork as \( f_2 \).

Initially, the beat frequency is given by:

\[
|f_1 - f_2| = 2 \, \text{Hz}
\]

This implies two possible scenarios for the unknown frequency:

1. \( f_2 = f_1 + 2 = 302 \, \text{Hz} \)
2. \( f_2 = f_1 - 2 = 298 \, \text{Hz} \)

When the unknown fork is loaded, the beat frequency increases to 5 beats per second. Let the frequency change due to loading be \(\Delta f\). Thus, the new frequency of the unknown fork is \( f_2 - \Delta f \) or \( f_2 + \Delta f \), depending on whether the frequency increases or decreases with loading. The beat frequency equation becomes:

\[
|f_1 - (f_2 \pm \Delta f)| = 5
\]

When the load is transferred to the known fork, the beat frequency increases to 9 beats per second:

\[
|(f_1 \pm \Delta f) - f_2| = 9
\]

Assuming the load produces the same frequency change \(\Delta f\) in each fork, we can solve these equations to find \( f_2 \).

Let's consider the first scenario where \( f_2 = 302 \, \text{Hz} \):

1. When the unknown fork is loaded:
   \[
   |300 - (302 \pm \Delta f)| = 5
   \]

   This gives two equations:
   \[
   |300 - (302 - \Delta f)| = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |2 + \Delta f| = 5
   \]
   \[
   |300 - (302 + \Delta f)| = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |-2 - \Delta f| = 5
   \]

2. When the known fork is loaded:
   \[
   |(300 \pm \Delta f) - 302| = 9
   \]

   This gives two equations:
   \[
   |300 + \Delta f - 302| = 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |\Delta f - 2| = 9
   \]
   \[
   |300 - \Delta f - 302| = 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |-\Delta f - 2| = 9
   \]

Solving these equations will give us the value of \(\Delta f\) and confirm the correct frequency of the unknown fork. Let's solve:

For \( |2 + \Delta f| = 5 \):
- \( 2 + \Delta f = 5 \) gives \(\Delta f = 3\)
- \( 2 + \Delta f = -5 \) gives \(\Delta f = -7\)

For \( |\Delta f - 2| = 9 \):
- \( \Delta f - 2 = 9 \) gives \(\Delta f = 11\)
- \( \Delta f - 2 = -9 \) gives \(\Delta f = -7\)

The consistent solution is \(\Delta f = -7\), which implies:

- For \( f_2 = 302 \, \text{Hz} \), the frequency change is negative, indicating the frequency decreases when loaded.

Thus, the frequency of the unknown fork (unloaded) is:

\[
f_2 = 302 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Therefore, the frequency of the unknown fork is \(\boxed{302 \, \text{Hz}}\)."

\section*{Problem}

A light pointer fixed to one prong of a tuning fork touches a vertical plate. The fork is set vibrating and the plate is allowed to fall freely. Eight complete oscillations are counted when the plate falls through 10 cm. What is the frequency of the tuning fork? [Indian Institute of Technology 1997]

\section*{Solution}

To find the frequency of the tuning fork, we can use the following approach:

Let \( f \) be the frequency of the tuning fork.

The time taken for the plate to fall through 10 cm can be found using the equation of motion:
\[
s = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]
where \( s = 0.1 \, \text{m} \) (since 10 cm = 0.1 m), and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

Solving for \( t \), we have:
\[
0.1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times t^2
\]
\[
t^2 = \frac{0.1 \times 2}{9.8}
\]
\[
t^2 = \frac{0.2}{9.8}
\]
\[
t = \sqrt{\frac{0.2}{9.8}}
\]

The number of oscillations \( n = 8 \), so the time for one oscillation \( T \) is:
\[
T = \frac{t}{n}
\]

The frequency \( f \) is the reciprocal of the period \( T \):
\[
f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{n}{t}
\]

Substituting the value of \( t \):
\[
f = \frac{8}{\sqrt{\frac{0.2}{9.8}}}
\]

Calculating this gives the frequency of the tuning fork.

\title{Resonance in a Closed Tube}

\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

Air in a tube closed at one end vibrates in resonance with a tuning fork whose frequencies are 210 and 350 vibrations per second, when the temperature is \SI{20}{\degreeCelsius}. Explain how this is possible and find the effective length of the tube. Assume that the velocity of sound in air at \SI{0}{\degreeCelsius} is \SI{331.5}{\centi\meter\per\second}.

\section*{Solution}

The velocity of sound in air at a temperature \( T \) in degrees Celsius can be given by the formula:
\[
v = v_0 \sqrt{1 + \frac{T}{273}}
\]
where \( v_0 = \SI{331.5}{\centi\meter\per\second} \) is the velocity of sound at \SI{0}{\degreeCelsius}.

Substituting \( T = \SI{20}{\degreeCelsius} \):
\[
v = \SI{331.5}{\centi\meter\per\second} \times \sqrt{1 + \frac{20}{273}}
\]

Calculating the above expression:
\[
v \approx \SI{331.5}{\centi\meter\per\second} \times \sqrt{1.0733} \approx \SI{343}{\centi\meter\per\second}
\]

For a tube closed at one end, the resonant frequencies \( f_n \) are given by:
\[
f_n = \frac{(2n-1)v}{4L}
\]
where \( n \) is the harmonic number, \( v \) is the velocity of sound, and \( L \) is the effective length of the tube.

Given the resonant frequencies \( f_1 = \SI{210}{\hertz} \) and \( f_2 = \SI{350}{\hertz} \), we can write:
\[
f_1 = \frac{v}{4L} \quad \text{and} \quad f_2 = \frac{3v}{4L}
\]

Solving for \( L \) using \( f_1 \):
\[
L = \frac{v}{4f_1} = \frac{\SI{343}{\centi\meter\per\second}}{4 \times \SI{210}{\hertz}}
\]
\[
L \approx \frac{\SI{343}{\centi\meter\per\second}}{\SI{840}{\hertz}} \approx \SI{0.408}{\meter}
\]

Thus, the effective length of the tube is approximately \SI{0.408}{\meter}.
