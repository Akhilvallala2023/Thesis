A uniform solid ball rolls down a slope. If the ball has a diameter of $0.5\,\mathrm{m}$ and a mass of $0.1\,\mathrm{kg}$, find the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] The equation which describes the velocity of the ball at any time, given that it starts from rest. Clearly state any assumptions you make.

    \item[(b)] If the slope has an incline of $30^\circ$ to the horizontal, what is the speed of the ball after it travels $3\,\mathrm{m}$?

    \item[(d)] If the coefficient of friction between the ball and the slope is $0.26$, what is the maximum angle of inclination the slope could have which still allows the ball to roll?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Assumptions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ball rolls without slipping.
    \item The only forces acting on the ball are gravity, normal force, and friction.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Solution Outline:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] To find the velocity of the ball at any time $t$, we use the equations of motion for rolling without slipping. The translational velocity $v(t)$ and the angular velocity $\omega(t)$ are related by $v(t) = R \omega(t)$, where $R$ is the radius of the ball. The acceleration $a$ can be found using Newton's second law and the rotational dynamics equation.

    \item[(b)] Using the kinematic equations and the known incline angle, calculate the speed of the ball after it travels $3\,\mathrm{m}$.

    \item[(c)] The angular momentum $L$ of the ball can be calculated using $L = I \omega$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the ball.

    \item[(d)] To find the maximum angle of inclination, use the condition for rolling without slipping, which involves the static frictional force and the gravitational component along the slope.
