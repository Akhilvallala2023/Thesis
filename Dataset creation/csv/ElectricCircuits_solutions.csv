In the segment \( \text{ACD} \), the two \( 3\,\Omega \) resistances give \( 6\,\Omega \), which with \( 6\,\Omega \) in parallel yields:
\[
\frac{6 \times 6}{6 + 6} = 3\,\Omega.
\]
This together with \( 3\,\Omega \) across \( \text{DE} \) in series, gives \( 6\,\Omega \), which together with \( 6\,\Omega \) across \( \text{AE} \) in parallel gives \( 3\,\Omega \).

By similar reasoning, the resistance along \( \text{AFB} \) is \( 6\,\Omega \), which with \( 3\,\Omega \) across \( \text{AB} \) in parallel yields the effective resistance across \( \text{AB} \):
\[
R_{AB} = \frac{6 \times 3}{6 + 3} = 2\,\Omega.

Let a current \( i \) enter at \( A \) and leave at \( C \). Currents in various branches are given by the junction theorem, as shown in Fig. 12.31. The potential difference is given by:

\[
V_{AB} + V_{BD} = V_{AD} \implies 3i_1 + 5i_2 = 6(i - i_1)
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
9i_1 + 5i_2 = 6i \tag{1}
\]

Similarly, for the potential difference \( V_{AC} \):

\[
V_{AC} = V_{AB} + V_{BC} = V_{AD} + V_{DC} \implies 3i_1 + 2(i_1 - i_2) = 6(i - i_1) + 4(i - i_1 + i_2)
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
15i_1 - 6i_2 = 10i \tag{2}
\]

Solving equations (1) and (2), we find \( i_2 = 0 \). Thus, the middle branch \( BD \) is rendered ineffective. Two resistances of \( 3 \, \Omega \) and \( 2 \, \Omega \) in series in the upper branch are to be combined in parallel with two other resistances of \( 6 \, \Omega \) and \( 4 \, \Omega \) in series in the lower branch to obtain the effective resistance between \( A \) and \( C \). This is given by:

\[
R_{\text{eff}} = \frac{(3 + 2)(6 + 4)}{(3 + 2) + (6 + 4)} = 3.33 \, \Omega
\]

This particular problem could have been easily solved by noticing that the Wheatstone bridge balance requirement is fulfilled since \( \frac{P}{Q} = \frac{R}{S} \); here \( \frac{3}{2} = \frac{6}{4} \), in which case the current in the middle branch is zero (see problem 12.33).

Let \( R_{\text{eq}} \) be the equivalent resistance of the circuit. Let a current \( i \) enter at \( X \) and emerge at \( Y \). The distribution of currents in various branches is shown in Fig. 12.34. The potential drop across \( X \) and \( Y \) is given by

\begin{equation}
V_{XY} = i R_{\text{eq}}

R = r + \frac{Rr}{R + r} + r

The total number of cells is \( N = m \times n \). Therefore, each row of cells will have an emf \( n\xi \) and the combined internal resistance \( nr \) (Fig. 12.39). The effective emf for \( m \) rows would again be \( n\xi \), but because the rows are in parallel, the effective internal resistance would become \( \frac{nr}{m} \). The total resistance then becomes \( R + \frac{nr}{m} \). The current through \( R \) will be 

\[
i = \frac{n\xi}{R + \frac{nr}{m}} = \frac{mnr}{Rm + nr} = \frac{Nr}{Rm + nr}
\]

Writing \( m = \frac{N}{n} \) in (1) and holding \( N \) as constant, maximum current \( i \) is found by setting \( \frac{\partial i}{\partial n} = 0 \). This gives 

\[
n^2 = \frac{RNr}{r} = \frac{Rmn}{r} \quad \text{or} \quad R = \frac{nr}{m}

Thus, the current is maximum when the cells are arranged such that their total internal resistance is equal to the external resistance.

The total power is given by:

The power ratio is:

Thus, we can determine each power component:
\[
P_1 = 250 \text{ W}, \quad P_2 = 150 \text{ W}, \quad P_3 = 100 \text{ W}
\]

The resistances can be calculated using the formula \( R = \frac{V^2}{P} \).

For \( R_1 \):
\[
R_1 = \frac{V^2}{P_1} = \frac{(200)^2}{250} = 160 \, \Omega

For \( R_2 \):
\[

Given the equation for the total current:
\begin{equation}
i_1 + i_2 + i_3 = i = 5 \, \text{A} \tag{1}
\end{equation}

Assuming $\rho = \text{const}$ and using the formula for resistance $R = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$ (see Fig. 12.45), we have the ratio of resistances:
\[
R_1 : R_2 : R_3 = \frac{l_1}{d_1^2} : \frac{l_2}{d_2^2} : \frac{l_3}{d_3^2}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\begin{equation}
R_1 : R_2 : R_3 = \frac{2}{3^2} : \frac{3}{4^2} : \frac{4}{5^2} = \frac{2}{9} : \frac{3}{16} : \frac{4}{25} \tag{2}
\end{equation}

Since the potential difference across all resistors is identical, we have:
\begin{equation}
i_1 R_1 = i_2 R_2 = i_3 R_3 \tag{3}
\end{equation}

Solving for $i_2$:
\begin{equation}
i_2 = i_1 \frac{R_1}{R_2} = i_1 \frac{\frac{2}{9}}{\frac{3}{16}} = \frac{32}{27} i_1 \tag{4}
\end{equation}

Solving for $i_3$:
\begin{equation}
i_3 = i_1 \frac{R_1}{R_3} = i_1 \frac{\frac{2}{9}}{\frac{4}{25}} = \frac{25}{18} i_1 \tag{5}
\end{equation}

Substituting into the total current equation:
\begin{equation}
i_1 + \frac{32}{27} i_1 + \frac{25}{18} i_1 = i = 5 \tag{6}

Solving the above equation gives:

As the P.D across the \(3\,\Omega\) and \(6\,\Omega\) resistors are equal:

As the P.D across the \(4\,\Omega\) and \(6\,\Omega\) resistors are equal:

\begin{equation}

Applying the junction theorem at Fig. 12.46:

\begin{equation}

\begin{equation}
    i_2 + i_3 = i_5 + i_6 \tag{5}

For the potential difference between points \(A\) and \(B\):

Thus,

\begin{equation}

Applying the loop theorem to loop \(CAFBC\):

\begin{equation}

Solving equations (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), we find:

\[

Let \( A \) and \( B \) be the midpoints of the coils. As no current flows through the galvanometer, the potential difference (P.D) across \( AB \) is zero. Applying the loop theorem to the main circuit, as shown in Fig. 12.47:

\[
\mathcal{E}_1 + \mathcal{E}_2 - i(R + R + r_1 + r_2) = 0
\]

Therefore, the current \( i \) is given by:

\[
i = \frac{\mathcal{E}_1 + \mathcal{E}_2}{2R + r_1 + r_2} = \frac{1.5 + 3}{2 \times 10 + 5 + r_2} = \frac{4.5}{25 + r_2} \tag{1}
\]

The P.D of the point \( B \) with respect to the negative terminal of the first cell is:

\[
V_B = \mathcal{E}_1 - \left(10 \times \frac{1}{2} + r_1\right) i = 1.5 - 10i \tag{2}
\]

The P.D of the point \( A \) with respect to the negative terminal of the first cell is:

\[
V_A = \mathcal{E}_1 + \mathcal{E}_2 - \left(10 \times \frac{1}{2} + r_2 + 10 + r_1\right) i = 1.5 + 3 - (5 + r_2 + 10 + 5)i = 4.5 - (20 + r_2)i
\]

But \( V_B = V_A \) (since no current flows through the galvanometer), hence:

\[
1.5 - 10i = 4.5 - (20 + r_2)i
\]

Solving for \( i \):

\[
i = \frac{3}{10 + r_2} \tag{3}
\]

From equations (1) and (3), we equate the expressions for \( i \):

\[
\frac{4.5}{25 + r_2} = \frac{3}{10 + r_2}
\]

Solving this equation for \( r_2 \), we find:

\[
r_2 = 20 \, \Omega

\section*{Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws}

\subsection*{(i) Kirchhoff's Rule 1 (Junction Theorem)}

At any junction of an electric network (branched circuit), the algebraic sum of the currents flowing towards that junction is zero (see Fig. 12.49).

\[
i_1 = i_2 + i_3 \quad \text{(Junction theorem)}
\]

\subsection*{Kirchhoff's Rule 2 (Loop Theorem)}

The sum of the changes in the potential encountered in traversing a loop (closed circuit) in a particular direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) is zero. If a resistor is traversed in the direction of the current, the change in the potential is $-iR$, while in the opposite direction it is $+iR$. If a seat of emf is traversed in the direction of emf, the change in potential is $+\xi$, while in the opposite direction it is $-\xi$.

\subsubsection*{Traversing the Top Loop Counterclockwise}

\[
-\xi_1 - i_2 R_2 + \xi_3 + \xi_2 - i_1 R_1 = 0 \quad \text{(Loop theorem)}
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
-11 - 200i_2 + 33 + 22 - 100i_1 = 0
\]

or

\[
100i_1 + 200i_2 - 44 = 0 \quad (2)
\]

\subsubsection*{Traversing the Bottom Loop Counterclockwise}

\[
-\xi_4 - i_3 R_3 + \xi_5 - \xi_3 + i_2 R_2 = 0
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
-44 - 300i_3 + 55 - 33 + 200i_2 = 0
\]

or

\[
200i_2 - 300i_3 - 22 = 0 \quad (3)

I_2 = I_T \times \frac{R_4}{R_4 + R_3} = 0.01 \times \frac{60}{60 + 20} = 0.0075 \, \text{A}
\]

The current through \( R_4 \) is:
\[
I_4 = I_T \times \frac{R_3}{R_4 + R_3} = 0.01 \times \frac{20}{60 + 20} = 0.0025 \, \text{A}

\section*{Physics Problem: Circuit Analysis}

Consider the following equations derived from the application of Kirchhoff's rules to the circuit shown in Fig. 12.50.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Equations}

1. \textbf{Junction Theorem:}

At the junction, the sum of currents is zero:
\begin{equation}
    i_1 - i_2 - i_3 = 0 \quad \text{(Junction theorem)}
\end{equation}

2. \textbf{Loop Theorem for the Top Loop:}

Traversing clockwise the top loop in Fig. \ref{fig:circuit}, we have:
\begin{equation}
    \xi_1 + i_1 R_1 - \xi_2 - \xi_4 + i_2 R_2 + \xi_3 = 0 \quad \text{(Loop theorem)}
\end{equation}

Simplifying, we get:
\begin{align*}
    5 + 10i_1 - 10 - 20 + 20i_2 + 15 &= 0 \\
    i_1 + 2i_2 - 1 &= 0 \quad \text{(2)}
\end{align*}

3. \textbf{Loop Theorem for the Bottom Loop:}

Traversing clockwise the bottom loop, we have:
\begin{equation}
    -\xi_3 - i_2 R_2 + \xi_4 - \xi_6 + i_3 R_4 + \xi_5 + i_3 R_3 = 0 \quad \text{(Loop theorem)}
\end{equation}

Simplifying, we get:
\begin{align*}
    -15 - 20i_2 + 20 - 30 + 40i_3 + 25 + 30i_3 &= 0 \\
    7i_3 - 2i_2 &= 0 \quad \text{(3)}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Conclusion}

The required equations for the unknown currents $i_1$, $i_2$, and $i_3$ are:
\begin{align}
    i_1 - i_2 - i_3 &= 0 \quad \text{(1)} \\
    i_1 + 2i_2 - 1 &= 0 \quad \text{(2)} \\
    7i_3 - 2i_2 &= 0 \quad \text{(3)}
\end{align}

These equations can be solved simultaneously to find the values of $i_1$, $i_2$, and $i_3$.

\section*{Physics Problem: Circuit Analysis}

Consider the following equations derived from the circuit in Fig. 12.51:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Junction Theorem:}
    \begin{equation}
        i_1 - i_2 - i_3 = 0
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Top Loop (Clockwise):}
    \begin{equation}
        \xi_4 - i_1 R_4 - \xi_5 - i_2 R_3 - \xi_2 - i_2 R_2 = 0
    \end{equation}
    Substituting the given values:
    \begin{align*}
        50 - 200i_1 - 30 - 80i_2 - 10 - 120i_2 &= 0 \\
        20i_1 + 20i_2 - 1 &= 0
    \end{align*}

    \item \textbf{Outer Loop (Clockwise):}
    \begin{equation}
        \xi_4 - i_1 R_4 - \xi_5 - i_3 R_5 - \xi_3 - i_3 R_1 + \xi_1 - i_3 R_6 = 0
    \end{equation}
    Substituting the given values:
    \begin{align*}
        50 - 200i_1 - 30 - 100i_3 - 20 - 60i_3 + 40 - 40i_3 &= 0 \\
        5i_1 + 5i_3 - 1 &= 0
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

The required equations are (1), (2), and (3) in three unknown currents $i_1$, $i_2$, and $i_3$. Note that by considering the bottom loop, no new information is provided as it is already contained in the other two loops. In general, it is sufficient to consider any two loops out of three.

\section*{Solution}

Consider the loop ABCDA traversed clockwise. The equation for the loop is:

\[
-iR - i_1 R_1 + \xi_2 - i r_2 - \xi_1 - i r_1 = 0
\]

Given:
\[ i_1 = \frac{2i}{3}, \quad i_2 = \frac{i}{3} \]

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[
-4.5i - 3 \times \frac{2i}{3} + 8 - i - 4 - 0.5i = 0
\]

Simplifying:

\[
-4.5i - 2i + 8 - i - 4 - 0.5i = 0
\]

\[
-8i + 4 = 0
\]

Solving for \( i \):

\[
i = 0.5 \, \text{A}
\]

Thus, the currents are:

\[
i_1 = \frac{2}{3} \times 0.5 = 0.33 \, \text{A}
\]

\[
i_2 = \frac{1}{3} \times 0.5 = 0.165 \, \text{A}
\]

Now, calculate the potential difference across \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \).

Potential difference over \( E_1 \):

\[
V_1 = \xi_1 + i r_1 = 4 + 0.5 \times 0.5 = 4.25 \, \text{V}
\]

Potential difference over \( E_2 \):

\[
V_2 = \xi_2 - i r_2 = 8 - 0.5 \times 1 = 7.5 \, \text{V}
\]
