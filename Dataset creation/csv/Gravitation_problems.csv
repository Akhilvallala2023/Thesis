\section*{Problem Statement}

Calculate the gravitational force between two lead spheres of radius 10 cm in contact with one another. The gravitational constant is given as \( G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \). The density of lead is \( 11,300 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \).

\section*{Solution Approach}

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for gravitational force between two masses:

\[
F = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( F \) is the gravitational force,
    \item \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
    \item \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two spheres,
    \item \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two spheres.
\end{itemize}

Since the spheres are in contact, the distance \( r \) is equal to twice the radius of one sphere, \( r = 2 \times 0.1 \, \text{m} = 0.2 \, \text{m} \).

The mass of each sphere can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere and the given density:

\[
m = \rho \cdot V = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \rho = 11,300 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) is the density of lead,
    \item \( r = 0.1 \, \text{m} \) is the radius of the sphere.
\end{itemize}

Substitute the values to find the gravitational force.

\section*{Gravitational Potential Inside a Uniform Solid Sphere}

Derive an expression for the gravitational potential \( V(r) \) due to a uniform solid sphere of mass \( M \) and radius \( R \) when \( r < R \).

\subsection*{Solution Outline}

To find the gravitational potential \( V(r) \) inside the sphere, we consider the following:

1. **Mass Distribution**: The sphere is uniformly distributed with mass \( M \) and radius \( R \).

2. **Gravitational Potential**: The gravitational potential \( V(r) \) at a distance \( r \) from the center of the sphere is given by:
   \[
   V(r) = -\int \frac{G \, dm}{r}
   \]
   where \( G \) is the gravitational constant and \( dm \) is the mass element.

3. **Integration Limits**: Since \( r < R \), we need to integrate from the center of the sphere to the point at distance \( r \).

4. **Density of Sphere**: The density \( \rho \) of the sphere is constant and given by:
   \[
   \rho = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}
   \]

5. **Mass Element**: The mass element \( dm \) can be expressed in terms of the volume element \( dV \) as:
   \[
   dm = \rho \, dV = \rho \, 4\pi r'^2 \, dr'
   \]
   where \( r' \) is the variable of integration.

6. **Expression for \( V(r) \)**: The potential \( V(r) \) inside the sphere is then calculated by integrating over the volume from \( 0 \) to \( r \).

\subsection*{Final Expression}

The final expression for the gravitational potential \( V(r) \) inside the sphere is:
\[
V(r) = -\frac{G M}{2 R^3} \left(3R^2 - r^2\right)
\]

5.12,"To derive an expression for the potential due to a thin uniform rod of mass \( M \) and length \( L \) at a point distant \( d \) from the center of the rod on the axial line of the rod, we start by considering the following setup:

1. **Setup and Variables:**
   - Let the rod be aligned along the \( x \)-axis, with its center at the origin.
   - The rod extends from \( x = -\frac{L}{2} \) to \( x = \frac{L}{2} \).
   - The point where we want to calculate the potential is located at a distance \( d \) from the center of the rod along the axial line.

2. **Expression for Potential:**
   - The potential \( V \) at a point due to a small element of mass \( dm \) is given by:
     \[
     dV = -\frac{G \, dm}{r}
     \]
     where \( G \) is the gravitational constant and \( r \) is the distance from the mass element \( dm \) to the point where the potential is being calculated.

3. **Mass Element:**
   - The linear mass density \( \lambda \) of the rod is:
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{M}{L}
     \]
   - A small element of the rod \( dx \) has mass:
     \[
     dm = \lambda \, dx = \frac{M}{L} \, dx
     \]

4. **Distance \( r \):**
   - The distance \( r \) from the element \( dm \) at position \( x \) to the point at distance \( d \) is:
     \[
     r = |d - x|
     \]

5. **Total Potential:**
   - Integrate \( dV \) over the length of the rod from \( x = -\frac{L}{2} \) to \( x = \frac{L}{2} \):
     \[
     V = -G \int_{-\frac{L}{2}}^{\frac{L}{2}} \frac{\lambda \, dx}{|d - x|}
     \]
   - Substituting \( \lambda = \frac{M}{L} \), the expression becomes:
     \[
     V = -\frac{GM}{L} \int_{-\frac{L}{2}}^{\frac{L}{2}} \frac{dx}{|d - x|}
     \]

This integral will yield the expression for the gravitational potential at the specified point. Note that the absolute value in the denominator ensures the correct distance is used regardless of the position of \( x \) relative to \( d \)."
5.13,"To show that for a satellite moving close to the Earth's surface along the equator, moving in the western direction will require a launching speed 11% higher than that moving in the eastern direction, we start by considering the rotational speed of the Earth and how it affects the required launch speed.

The Earth's rotational speed at the equator is given by:

\[
v_{\text{earth}} = \omega_{\text{earth}} R_{\text{earth}}
\]

where:
- \(\omega_{\text{earth}}\) is the angular velocity of the Earth's rotation,
- \(R_{\text{earth}}\) is the radius of the Earth.

For a satellite moving in the eastern direction, the effective launch speed \(v_{\text{launch, east}}\) is reduced by the Earth's rotational speed:

\[
v_{\text{launch, east}} = v_{\text{orbital}} - v_{\text{earth}}
\]

For a satellite moving in the western direction, the effective launch speed \(v_{\text{launch, west}}\) is increased by the Earth's rotational speed:

\[
v_{\text{launch, west}} = v_{\text{orbital}} + v_{\text{earth}}
\]

We are given that the launch speed in the western direction is 11% higher than that in the eastern direction:

\[
v_{\text{launch, west}} = 1.11 \times v_{\text{launch, east}}
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(v_{\text{launch, east}}\) and \(v_{\text{launch, west}}\):

\[
v_{\text{orbital}} + v_{\text{earth}} = 1.11 \times (v_{\text{orbital}} - v_{\text{earth}})
\]

This equation can be solved to verify the relationship between the launch speeds in the eastern and western directions."

    \item[(ii)] Derive a formula to estimate the mass of the Sun ($G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{(i) Kepler's Third Law:}

Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period $T$ of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis $r$ of its orbit:

\[
T^2 \propto r^3
\]

For Earth and Venus, we can express this as:

\[
\left(\frac{T_E}{T_V}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{r_E}{r_V}\right)^3
\]

where:
\begin{align*}
T_E &= 365.3 \, \text{days}, \\
T_V &= 224.7 \, \text{days}, \\
r_E &= 1.50 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m}, \\
r_V &= 1.08 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m}.
\end{align*}

\textbf{(ii) Estimating the Mass of the Sun:}

Using Newton's version of Kepler's third law, we have:

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} r^3
\]

Solving for the mass of the Sun $M$, we get:

\[
M = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Assuming that the Earth (mass $M_E$) orbits the Sun (mass $M_S$) in a circle of radius $R$ and with a speed $v$, write down the equation of motion for the Earth. Hence, show that $G M_S = v^2 R$.

    \item[(b)] A comet is in orbit around the Sun in the same plane as the Earth's orbit, as shown in Fig. 5.8. Its distance of closest approach to the Sun's center is $R/2$, at which point it has speed $2v$. Using the condition for the Earth's orbit given in (a), show that the comet's total energy is zero. (Neglect the effect of the Earth on the comet.)

    \item[(c)] Use conservation of angular momentum to determine the component of the comet's velocity which is tangential to the Earth's orbit at the point $P$, where the comet's orbit crosses that of the Earth.

    \item[(d)] Use conservation of energy to find its speed at the point $P$. Hence, show that the comet crosses the Earth's orbit at an angle of $45^\circ$.

    \hfill [University of Manchester 2008]
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] The gravitational force acting on the Earth due to the Sun is given by:
    \[
    F = \frac{G M_S M_E}{R^2}
    \]
    This force provides the necessary centripetal force for the Earth's circular motion:
    \[
    \frac{G M_S M_E}{R^2} = \frac{M_E v^2}{R}
    \]
    Simplifying, we obtain:
    \[
    G M_S = v^2 R
    \]

    \item[(b)] At the closest approach, the comet's speed is $2v$ and its distance from the Sun is $R/2$. The total energy $E$ of the comet is given by:
    \[
    E = \frac{1}{2} m (2v)^2 - \frac{G M_S m}{R/2}
    \]
    Using the condition from part (a), show that $E = 0$.

    \item[(c)] By conservation of angular momentum, the angular momentum at the closest approach and at point $P$ are equal:
    \[
    m (2v) \frac{R}{2} = m v_t R
    \]
    Solve for $v_t$, the tangential component of the comet's velocity at point $P$.

    \item[(d)] Using conservation of energy, find the speed $v_P$ at point $P$:
    \[
    \frac{1}{2} m v_P^2 - \frac{G M_S m}{R} = 0
    \]
    Solve for $v_P$ and show that the comet crosses the Earth's orbit at an angle of $45^\circ$.

5.35,"To demonstrate the consistency of the given data with the conservation of angular momentum for the satellite 'Apple', we can express the angular momentum \( L \) at perigee and apogee. According to the conservation of angular momentum, the angular momentum at perigee should equal the angular momentum at apogee. The angular momentum \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = m \cdot r \cdot v
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the satellite, \( r \) is the radial distance from the center of the Earth, and \( v \) is the tangential velocity of the satellite. Since \( m \) is constant, we can equate the angular momentum at perigee and apogee:

\[
m \cdot r_p \cdot v_p = m \cdot r_A \cdot v_A
\]

Canceling the mass \( m \) from both sides, we have:

\[
r_p \cdot v_p = r_A \cdot v_A

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] \textbf{Forces Acting on the Satellite:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The primary force acting on the satellite is the gravitational force exerted by the Earth.

\section*{Time Required to Describe an Arc of a Parabola}

To find the time required to describe an arc of a parabola under the action of a force \( \frac{k}{r^2} \) directed towards the focus, starting from the end of the axis, we consider the following setup:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \( F \) be the focus of the parabola.
    \item Let \( A \) be the starting point at the end of the axis.
    \item The force acting on a particle is given by \( F = \frac{k}{r^2} \), where \( r \) is the distance from the focus \( F \).
\end{itemize}

The equation of motion can be derived from Newton's second law:

\[
m \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = -\frac{k}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the particle, \( \mathbf{r} \) is the position vector, and \( \hat{\mathbf{r}} \) is the unit vector in the direction of \( \mathbf{r} \).

To find the time \( t \) required to describe the arc, we need to integrate the motion equations. The integration will depend on the specific form of the parabola and initial conditions.

The integral expression for the time \( t \) can be written as:

\[
t = \int_{A}^{B} \frac{ds}{v}
\]

where \( ds \) is the differential arc length and \( v \) is the velocity of the particle.

The velocity \( v \) can be expressed in terms of the energy conservation principle:

\[
\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{k}{r} + C
\]

where \( C \) is the integration constant determined by initial conditions.

Further simplification and evaluation of this integral will provide the expression for the time \( t \).

Find the law of force to the pole when the orbit described by the cardioid is given by:

\section*{Solution}

To find the law of force, we start by considering the orbit equation in polar coordinates. The force \( F \) acting on a particle in polar coordinates is related to the potential energy \( V(r) \) by:

\begin{equation}
    F = -\frac{dV}{dr}
\end{equation}

For a central force problem, the effective potential \( V_{\text{eff}}(r) \) is given by:

\begin{equation}
    V_{\text{eff}}(r) = V(r) + \frac{L^2}{2mr^2}

\begin{equation}
