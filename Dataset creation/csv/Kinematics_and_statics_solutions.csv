\subsection*{(a) Equations of Motion}

The equation of motion for the truck is given by:
\begin{equation}
    s = ut \tag{1}
\end{equation}

The equation of motion for the car is:
\begin{equation}
    s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \tag{2}
\end{equation}

The graphs for equations (1) and (2) are shown in Fig. 1.13. By eliminating \( t \) between the two equations, we have:
\begin{equation}
    s \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{as}{u^2} \right) = 0 \tag{3}
\end{equation}

From Fig. 1.13, either \( s = 0 \) or \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{as}{u^2} = 0 \).

The first solution corresponds to the result that the truck overtakes the car at \( s = 0 \) and therefore at \( t = 0 \).

The second solution gives:
\[
s = \frac{2u^2}{a} = \frac{2 \times 10^2}{2} = 100 \, \text{m}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Time Calculation}

The time \( t \) is calculated as:
\[
t = \frac{s}{u} = \frac{100}{10} = 10 \, \text{s}
\]

\subsection*{(c) Velocity Calculation}

The velocity \( v \) is given by:
\[
v = at = 2 \times 10 = 20 \, \text{m/s}
\]

When the stone reaches a height $h$ above $A$, the velocity is given by:
\begin{equation}
v_1^2 = u^2 - 2gh \tag{1}
\end{equation}

When it reaches a distance $h$ below $A$, the velocity is:
\begin{equation}
v_2^2 = u^2 + 2gh \tag{2}
\end{equation}

Since the velocity of the stone while crossing $A$ on its return journey is again $u$ vertically down, and given that $v_2 = 2v_1$ (by problem statement), we have:
\begin{equation}
v_2 = 2v_1 \tag{3}
\end{equation}

Combining equations (1), (2), and (3), we find:
\begin{equation}
u^2 = 10 \cdot 3 \cdot gh \tag{4}
\end{equation}

The maximum height $H$ is given by:
\begin{align*}
H &= \frac{u^2}{2g} \\
  &= \frac{10 \cdot 3 \cdot gh}{2g} \\
  &= \frac{30gh}{2g} \\

The distance covered by the first stone is given by:

where \( h = 19.6 \, \text{m} \).

For the second stone:
\begin{equation}
s = ut = \frac{1}{2} g t^2

The velocity equation for the second stone is:
\begin{equation}
v^2 = 0 = u^2 - 2gh \quad \Rightarrow \quad u = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.8 \times 19.6} = 19.6 \, \text{m/s}

Adding equations (1) and (2), we have:
\begin{equation}
h = ut \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \frac{h}{u} = \frac{19.6}{19.6} = 1 \, \text{s}

\section*{Problem Solution}

Consider a lamp positioned at point \( A \) at a height \( H \) from the ground, such that \( AB = H \), as shown in Fig. 1.14. A man starts at point \( B \), directly below the lamp, with his height being \( BD = h \). Initially, the tip of his shadow is at \( B \).

As the man walks from \( B \) to \( F \) in time \( t \) with speed \( v \), the shadow moves to point \( C \) in the same time \( t \) with speed \( v' \). Refer to Fig. 1.14 for the setup.

The distances covered are:
\[
BF = vt, \quad BC = v't
\]

From the similar triangles \( \triangle EFC \) and \( \triangle ABC \), we have the proportion:
\[
\frac{FC}{BC} = \frac{EF}{AB} = \frac{h}{H}
\]

This gives us:
\[
\frac{v't - vt}{v't} = \frac{h}{H}
\]

Solving for \( v' \), we find:
\[
v' = \frac{Hv}{H - h}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
v' = \frac{6 \times 7}{6 - 1.8} = 10 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the speed of the shadow is \( 10 \, \text{m/s} \).

\section*{Solution}

Given the equation:
\begin{equation}
    \sqrt{3x} = 3t - 6
\end{equation}

Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get:
\begin{equation}
    x = 3t^2 - 12t + 12
\end{equation}

The velocity \( v \) is given by the derivative of \( x \) with respect to \( t \):
\begin{equation}
    v = \frac{dx}{dt} = 6t - 12
\end{equation}

Setting \( v = 0 \) gives:
\begin{equation}
    6t - 12 = 0 \implies t = 2
\end{equation}

Using \( t = 2 \) in equation (2) gives the displacement:
\begin{equation}
    x = 3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 12 = 0

Physically, the difference between $t_1$ and $t_2$ on the one hand, and $v$ and $u$ on the other hand, arises due to the fact that during ascent both gravity and air resistance act downward (friction acts opposite to motion), but during descent, gravity and air resistance are oppositely directed. Air resistance $F$ actually increases with the velocity of the object ($F \propto v$, $v^2$, or $v^3$). Here, for simplicity, we assume it to be constant.

For upward motion, the equation of motion is 
\begin{equation}
    ma_1 = -(F + mg) \quad \text{or} \quad a_1 = -\left(\frac{F}{m} + g\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation}

For downward motion, the equation of motion is 
\begin{equation}
    ma_2 = mg - F \quad \text{or} \quad a_2 = g - \frac{F}{m} \tag{2}
\end{equation}

For ascent, 
\begin{align}
    v_1 &= 0 = u + a_1 t = u - \left(\frac{F}{m} + g\right) t_1 \\
    t_1 &= \frac{u}{g + \frac{F}{m}} \tag{3}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    v_1^2 &= 0 = u^2 + 2a_1 h \\
    u &= \sqrt{2h\left(g + \frac{F}{m}\right)} \tag{4}
\end{align}

where we have used (1). Using (4) in (3),
\begin{equation}
    t_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g + \frac{F}{m}}} \tag{5}
\end{equation}

For descent,
\begin{align}
    v_2 &= \sqrt{2a_2 h} \\
    v &= \sqrt{2h\left(g - \frac{F}{m}\right)} \tag{6}
\end{align}

where we have used (2).

\begin{equation}
    t_2 = \frac{v}{a_2} = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g - \frac{F}{m}}} \tag{7}
\end{equation}

where we have used (2) and (6).

From (5) and (7),
\begin{equation}
    \frac{t_2}{t_1} = \sqrt{\frac{g + \frac{F}{m}}{g - \frac{F}{m}}} \tag{8}
\end{equation}

It follows that $t_2 > t_1$, that is, the time of descent is greater than the time of ascent.

Further, from (4) and (6),
\begin{equation}
    \frac{v}{u} = \sqrt{\frac{g - \frac{F}{m}}{g + \frac{F}{m}}} \tag{9}
\end{equation}

It follows that $v < u$, that is, the final speed is smaller than the initial speed.

Taking the downward direction as positive, the equation of motion is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dv}{dt} = g - kv \tag{1}
\end{equation}

where \( k \) is a constant. Integrating both sides, we have:

\[
\int \frac{dv}{g-kv} = \int dt
\]

This leads to:

\[
-\frac{1}{k} \ln \left( \frac{g-kv}{c} \right) = t
\]

where \( c \) is a constant. Solving for \( v \), we get:

\begin{equation}
    g - kv = ce^{-kt} \tag{2}
\end{equation}

This equation gives the velocity at any instant. As \( t \) increases, \( e^{-kt} \) decreases, and if \( t \) increases indefinitely, \( g - kv = 0 \), i.e.,

\begin{equation}
    v = \frac{g}{k} \tag{3}
\end{equation}

This limiting velocity is called the terminal velocity. We can obtain an expression for the distance \( x \) traversed in time \( t \). First, we identify the constant \( c \) in equation (2). Since it is assumed that \( v = 0 \) at \( t = 0 \), it follows that \( c = g \).

Writing \( v = \frac{dx}{dt} \) in equation (2) and substituting \( c = g \), we have:

\[
g - k \frac{dx}{dt} = g e^{-kt}
\]

Integrating both sides:

\[
\int g \, dt - k \int dx = g \int e^{-kt} \, dt + D
\]

Solving the integrals, we get:

\[
gt - kx = -\frac{g}{k} e^{-kt} + D
\]

At \( x = 0 \), \( t = 0 \); therefore, \( D = \frac{g}{k} \). Substituting \( D \) back, we find:

\begin{equation}
    x = \frac{gt}{k} - \frac{g}{k^2} \left( 1 - e^{-kt} \right) \tag{4}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(i)}

Given the differential equation:
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = 6 + 2t
\]

Integrating both sides:
\[
\int dx = \int (6 + 2t) \, dt
\]

\[
x = 6t + \int 2t \, dt = 6t + t^2 + C
\]

Given the initial condition \( x = 0 \) at \( t = 0 \):
\[
0 = 6 \times 0 + 0^2 + C \implies C = 0
\]

Thus, the solution for \( x \) is:
\[
x = 6t + t^2
\]

Now, for \( y \):
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = 4 + t
\]

Integrating both sides:
\[
\int dy = \int (4 + t) \, dt
\]

\[
y = 4t + \int t \, dt = 4t + \frac{t^2}{2} + D
\]

Given the initial condition \( y = 0 \) at \( t = u \):
\[
0 = 4u + \frac{u^2}{2} + D \implies D = -4u - \frac{u^2}{2}
\]

Thus, the solution for \( y \) is:
\[
y = u + 4t + \frac{t^2}{2}
\]

\subsection*{(ii)}

The velocity vector is given by:
\[
\vec{v} = (6 + 2t)\hat{i} + (4 + t)\hat{j}
\]

\subsection*{(iii)}

The acceleration vector is the derivative of the velocity vector:
\[
\vec{a} = \dv{\vec{v}}{t} = 2\hat{i} + \hat{j}
\]

\subsection*{(iv)}

The magnitude of the acceleration is:
\[
a = \sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{5}
\]

The angle \( \theta \) with the x-axis is given by:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{1}{2} \implies \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \approx 26.565^\circ
\]

Thus, the acceleration is directed at an angle of \( 26^\circ 34' \) with the x-axis.

Take the upward direction as positive. Referring to Fig. 1.18, at time $t$, the velocities of the objects will be:

\section*{Problem: Bullet and Monkey}

Let the rifle be fixed at point \( A \) and point in the direction \( AB \) at an angle \( \alpha \) with the horizontal. The monkey is sitting on the tree top at \( B \) at height \( h \), as shown in Fig. 1.21. The bullet follows a parabolic path and reaches point \( D \), at height \( H \), in time \( t \).

\end{figure}

The horizontal and initial vertical components of the bullet's velocity are:
\[
u_x = u \cos \alpha, \quad u_y = u \sin \alpha
\]

Let the bullet reach point \( D \), vertically below \( B \) in time \( t \), with the coordinates of \( D \) being \( (d, H) \). Since the horizontal component of velocity is constant, we have:
\[
d = u_x t = (u \cos \alpha) t = u \cdot t \quad \text{where} \quad s = AB: \quad t = \frac{s}{u}
\]

The vertical component of velocity is reduced due to gravity. In the same time, the \( y \)-coordinate at \( D \) is given by:
\[
y = H = u_y t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 = u (\sin \alpha) t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2
\]

Substituting for \( t \), we get:
\[
H = u \left(\frac{h}{s}\right) \left(\frac{s}{u}\right) - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 = h - \frac{1}{2}gt^2
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
h - H = \frac{1}{2}gt^2
\]

Solving for \( t \), we find:
\[
t = \sqrt{\frac{2(h - H)}{g}}
\]

However, the quantity \( (h - H) \) represents the height through which the monkey drops from the tree, and the right-hand side of the last equation gives the time for a free fall. Therefore, the bullet would hit the monkey independent of the bullet's initial velocity.

Let \( P \) be the position of the boat at any time. Let \( AP = r \), \(\angle B\hat{A}P = \theta\), and let \( v \) be the magnitude of each velocity, as shown in Fig. 1.5. The equations of motion are given by:

\[
\frac{dr}{dt} = -v + v \sin \theta
\]

\[
r \frac{d\theta}{dt} = v \cos \theta
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{r} \frac{dr}{d\theta} = -1 + \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}
\]

Integrating both sides, we get:

\[
\int \frac{dr}{r} = \int \left(-\sec \theta + \tan \theta\right) d\theta

\[
\ln r = -\ln \tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \ln \cos \theta + \ln C \quad (\text{a constant})

When \(\theta = 0\), \(r = a\), so that \(C = a\). Therefore:

\[
r = a \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \cos \theta

The denominator can be shown to be equal to \(1 + \sin \theta\):

Take the origin at \( O \), as shown in Fig. 1.22. Draw the reference line \( OC \) parallel to \( AB \), the ground level. Let the ball hit the wall at a height \( H \) above \( C \).

Initially at \( O \), as shown in Fig. 1.22:
\[
u_x = u \cos \alpha = u \cos 45^\circ = \frac{u}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
\[
u_y = u \sin \alpha = u \sin 45^\circ = \frac{u}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

When the ball hits the wall, the vertical position is given by:
\[
y = x \tan \alpha - \frac{1}{2} \frac{g x^2}{u^2 \cos^2 \alpha}
\]

Using \( y = H \), \( x = d \), and \( \alpha = 45^\circ \), we have:
\[
H = d \left( 1 - \frac{g d}{u^2} \right) \tag{1}
\]

If the collision of the ball with the wall is perfectly elastic, then at point \( P \), the horizontal component of the velocity (\( u'_x \)) will be reversed, with the magnitude remaining constant, while both the direction and magnitude of the vertical component \( v'_y \) are unaltered.

If the time taken for the ball to bounce back from \( P \) to \( A \) is \( t \) and the range \( BA = R \), then:
\[
y = v'_y t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \tag{2}
\]

Using:
\[
t = \frac{R}{u \cos 45^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{2} R}{u} \tag{3}

\[
y = -(H + h) \tag{4}

The vertical velocity component is:
\[
v'_y t = u \sin 45^\circ - \frac{g d}{u \cos 45^\circ} = \frac{u}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{\sqrt{2} g d}{u} \tag{5}
\]

Using equations (3), (4), and (5) in equation (2), we get a quadratic equation in \( R \) which has the acceptable solution:
\[
R = \frac{u^2}{2g} + \sqrt{\frac{u^2}{4g^2} + H + h}

\subsection*{(i) Force Components}

Resolve the force into \( x \) and \( y \) components:

\[
F_x = -80 \cos 35^\circ + 60 + 40 \cos 45^\circ = 22.75 \, \text{N}

\[
F_y = 80 \sin 35^\circ + 0 - 40 \sin 45^\circ = 17.6 \, \text{N}

Calculate the net force:

\[
F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2} = \sqrt{(22.75)^2 + (17.6)^2} = 28.76 \, \text{N}
\]

Determine the angle \(\theta\) that the vector \( F_{\text{net}} \) makes with the \( x \)-axis:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{F_y}{F_x} = \frac{17.6}{22.75} = 0.7736 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta = 37.7^\circ
\]

Thus, the vector \( F_{\text{net}} \) makes an angle of \( 37.7^\circ \) with the \( x \)-axis.

\subsection*{(ii) Acceleration}

Calculate the acceleration \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{28.76 \, \text{N}}{3.8 \, \text{kg}} = 7.568 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

\subsection*{(iii) Opposing Force}

To balance the net force, a force \( F_4 \) of magnitude \( 28.76 \, \text{N} \) must be applied in the opposite direction to \( F_{\text{net}} \).

    \[
    F = ma

    \item Frictional force: 
    \[
    F_r = \mu mg

Equating the forces, we have:

Solving for acceleration \(a\), we get:
\[
\mu g = a

Given \(\mu = 1.5\) and \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\), the acceleration \(a\) is calculated as follows:

Taking torque about point \( D \), the corner of the obstacle, we have:

Referring to Fig. 1.23, we can express the force \( F \) in terms of the weight \( W \) and the distances \( BD \) and \( CD \):

To find \( CD \), we use the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
CD = \sqrt{OD^2 - OB^2}

Substituting the known values, we have:

\[
CD = \sqrt{r^2 - (r - h)^2}

Thus, the expression for \( CE - DE \) becomes:

For continuous mass distribution, the \( y \)-coordinate of the center of mass is given by:

Let \(\sigma\) be the surface density (mass per unit area), so that the total mass \( M \) is:
\[

In polar coordinates, the differential mass element is:
\[

Let the center of mass be located at a distance \( y_{\text{CM}} \) from \( O \) along the \( y \)-axis for reasons of symmetry:

y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 \sigma} \int_0^R \int_0^\pi (r \sin \theta)(\sigma r \, d\theta \, dr)

Simplifying, we have:

Evaluating the integral over \(\theta\):

Thus, the expression becomes:

y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{2}{\pi R^2} \cdot 2 \int_0^R r^2 \, dr

Calculating the integral over \( r \):
\[
\int_0^R r^2 \, dr = \left[ \frac{r^3}{3} \right]_0^R = \frac{R^3}{3}

Substituting back, we find:

y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{4}{3\pi} R

Let the centre of the original disc be at $O$, as shown in Fig. 1.10. The hole touches the circumference of the disc at $A$, with the centre of the hole being at $C$. When this hole is cut, let the centre of mass of the remaining part be at $G$, such that $OG = x$ or $AG = AO + OG = R + x$.

If we put back the cut portion of the hole and fill it up, then the centre of mass of this small disc (at $C$) and that of the remaining portion (at $G$) must be located at the centre of the original disc at $O$. Therefore, we have:

The boat has a mass \( M \) and length \( L \), with its center of mass at point \( C \). Let the center of mass of the boat+boy system be located at \( G \), at a distance \( x \) from the origin.

The position of the center of mass \( G \) is given by:

\[
AG = x = \frac{M \cdot AC + m \cdot AB}{M + m} = \frac{100 \times 1.5 + 50 \times 3}{100 + 50} = 2 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the distance \( CG \) is:

\[
CG = AG - AC = 2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \, \text{m}
\]

When the boy reaches \( A \), from symmetry, the center of mass of the boat+boy system would have moved to \( H \) by a distance of \( 0.5 \, \text{m} \) on the left side of \( C \). 

Now, in the absence of external forces, the center of mass should not move. Therefore, to restore the original position of the center of mass, the boat moves towards the right so that point \( H \) is brought back to the original mark \( G \). 

Since \( HG = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0 \, \text{m} \), the boat, in the meantime, moves through \( 1.0 \, \text{m} \) towards the right.

If the rod is to move with pure translation without rotation, then it should be struck at \( C \), the centre of mass of the loaded rod. Let \( C \) be located at distance \( x \) from \( A \) so that \( GC = \frac{1}{2}L - x \), as shown in Fig. 1.30. Let \( M \) be the mass of the rod and \( 2M \) be the mass attached at \( A \).

Taking torques about \( C \) (see Fig. 1.30):

\[
2Mx = M \left( \frac{L}{2} - x \right)
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
2Mx = M \left( \frac{L}{2} - x \right) \implies 2Mx = \frac{ML}{2} - Mx
\]

\[
3Mx = \frac{ML}{2} \implies x = \frac{L}{6}
\]

Thus, the rod should be struck at a distance \( \frac{L}{6} \) from the loaded end.

\section*{Volume and Center of Mass of a Cone}

The volume of the cone, \( V \), is given by:
\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi R^2 h
\]
where \( R \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is its height, as shown in Fig. 1.31.

The volume element at a depth \( z \) below the apex is:
\[
dV = \pi r^2 \, dz
\]

The mass element is:
\[
dm = \rho \, dV = \rho \pi r^2 \, dz
\]

From Fig. 1.31, we have:
\[
dm = \rho \, dv = \rho \pi r^2 \, dz
\]

Using similar triangles, we relate \( z \) and \( r \) as follows:
\[
\frac{z}{r} = \frac{h}{R} \quad \Rightarrow \quad dz = \frac{h}{R} \, dr
\]

For reasons of symmetry, the center of mass must lie on the axis of the cone. Taking the origin at \( O \), the apex of the cone, the center of mass \( Z_{\text{CM}} \) is given by:
\[
Z_{\text{CM}} = \frac{\int Z \, dm}{\int dm}
\]

Substituting the expressions, we have:
\[
Z_{\text{CM}} = \frac{\int_0^R \left(\frac{hr}{R}\right) \rho \pi r^2 \left(\frac{h}{R} \, dr\right)}{\frac{1}{3} \pi R^2 h \rho}
\]

Simplifying, we find:
\[
Z_{\text{CM}} = \frac{3h}{4}
\]

Thus, the center of mass is located at a height \( h - \frac{3}{4} h = \frac{1}{4} h \) above the center of the base of the cone.

\section*{Problem Statement}

Take the origin at \( O \), as shown in Fig. 1.32. Let the mass of the wire be \( M \). Consider a mass element \( dm \) at angles \( \theta \) and \( \theta + d\theta \) (see Fig. 1.32). The mass element is given by:

\[
dm = \frac{M R d\theta}{2\alpha R} = \frac{M d\theta}{2\alpha}
\]

From symmetry, the center of mass (CM) of the wire must be on the \( y \)-axis. The \( y \)-coordinate of \( dm \) is \( y = R \sin \theta \). The \( y \)-coordinate of the center of mass \( y_{\text{CM}} \) is given by:

\[
y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M} \int y \, dm = \frac{1}{M} \int_{90^\circ - \alpha}^{90^\circ + \alpha} R \sin \theta \, \frac{M d\theta}{2\alpha}
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{R}{2\alpha} \int_{90^\circ - \alpha}^{90^\circ + \alpha} \sin \theta \, d\theta
\]

Evaluating the integral, we find:

\[
y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{R \sin \alpha}{\alpha}
\]

Note that the results of problem (1.43) follow for \( \alpha = \frac{1}{2} \pi \).

The center of mass (CM) coordinates of three individual laminas are given by:

\]

To find the CM coordinates of the system of these three laminas, we use the formula for the center of mass of a system of particles:
\[
x_{\text{CM}} = \frac{m \cdot \frac{a}{2} + m \cdot \frac{3a}{2} + m \cdot \frac{3a}{2}}{m + m + m} = \frac{7a}{6}

y_{\text{CM}} = \frac{m \cdot \frac{a}{2} + m \cdot \frac{a}{2} + m \cdot \frac{3a}{2}}{m + m + m} = \frac{5a}{6}

Thus, the CM coordinates of the system are:

The potential energy function is given by:

The first derivative of \( U(x) \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dU(x)}{dx} = k(6x^2 - 10x + 4)

Evaluating the first derivative at \( x = 1 \):
\[

For a stable equilibrium position of the particle, it should be a minimum. To determine this, we differentiate equation (2) again:

Evaluating the second derivative at \( x = 1 \):
\[
    \left. \frac{d^2U(x)}{dx^2} \right|_{x=1} = k(12(1) - 10) = +2k

Differentiating with respect to \(x\), we have:

At \(x = 2l\), the derivative becomes:

Differentiating equation (2) again, we find:
