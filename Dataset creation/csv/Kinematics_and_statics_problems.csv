\section*{Motion of a Body Falling Under Gravity with Air Resistance}

Consider a body of mass \( m \) falling under the influence of gravity, with air resistance proportional to its velocity. Let \( v(t) \) be the velocity of the body at time \( t \), \( g \) be the acceleration due to gravity, and \( k \) be the proportionality constant for air resistance. The forces acting on the body are:

1. Gravitational force: \( F_g = mg \)
2. Air resistance: \( F_r = -kv(t) \)

According to Newton's second law, the net force acting on the body is equal to the mass of the body times its acceleration:

\[
m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - kv(t)
\]

This can be rearranged to form the following first-order linear differential equation:

\[
\frac{dv}{dt} = g - \frac{k}{m}v(t)
\]

The solution to this differential equation will describe the velocity \( v(t) \) of the body as a function of time, considering the initial conditions.

\section*{Motion of a Body Falling Under Gravity with Air Resistance}

Consider a body of mass $m$ falling under the influence of gravity. Let $v(t)$ be the velocity of the body at time $t$. The force due to gravity is given by $mg$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The resistance of air is assumed to be proportional to the square of the velocity, which can be expressed as $kv^2$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.

The equation of motion for the body can be written using Newton's second law:

\begin{equation}
    m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - kv^2.
\end{equation}

Rearranging the terms, we have:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dv}{dt} = g - \frac{k}{m}v^2.

\section*{Problem Statement}

Find the center of mass of a solid cone of height \( h \).

\section*{Solution}

To find the center of mass of a solid cone, we consider the cone with base radius \( R \) and height \( h \). The cone is oriented such that its vertex is at the origin and its base is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane at \( z = h \).

The volume element in cylindrical coordinates is given by:
\[
dV = r \, dr \, d\theta \, dz
\]

The limits of integration for \( r \), \( \theta \), and \( z \) are:
\[
0 \leq r \leq \frac{R}{h}z, \quad 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi, \quad 0 \leq z \leq h
\]

The center of mass \( \bar{z} \) along the \( z \)-axis can be calculated using:
\[
\bar{z} = \frac{1}{V} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^h \int_0^{\frac{R}{h}z} z \, r \, dr \, d\theta \, dz
\]

where \( V \) is the total volume of the cone:
\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi R^2 h

The linear density of a rod of length $L$ is directly proportional to the distance from one end. Let the linear density be given by $\lambda(x) = kx$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality and $x$ is the distance from one end of the rod.

To locate the center of mass from the same end, we use the formula for the center of mass $x_{\text{cm}}$ of a continuous mass distribution:

\[
x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{M} \int_0^L x \lambda(x) \, dx
\]

where $M$ is the total mass of the rod, given by:

\[
M = \int_0^L \lambda(x) \, dx = \int_0^L kx \, dx
\]

Substituting $\lambda(x) = kx$ into the expression for $x_{\text{cm}}$, we have:

\[
x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{M} \int_0^L x(kx) \, dx = \frac{k}{M} \int_0^L x^2 \, dx
