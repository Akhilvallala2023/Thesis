\section*{Problem A2}

A \(2.5 \, \mu\text{F}\) capacitor is connected in series with a non-inductive resistor of \(300 \, \Omega\) across a source of potential difference (PD) of rms value \(50 \, \text{V}\), alternating at \(\frac{1000}{2\pi} \, \text{Hz}\). Calculate:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] The thermal values of the current in the circuit and the PD across the capacitor.
    \item[(b)] The mean rate at which the energy is supplied by the source.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsubsection*{(a) Thermal Values of the Current and PD across the Capacitor}

The angular frequency \(\omega\) is given by:
\[
\omega = 2\pi f = 1000 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

The capacitive reactance \(X_C\) is:
\[
X_C = \frac{1}{\omega C} = \frac{1}{1000 \times 2.5 \times 10^{-6}} = 400 \, \Omega
\]

The total impedance \(Z\) of the circuit is:
\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X_C^2} = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = 500 \, \Omega
\]

The rms current \(I\) in the circuit is:
\[
I = \frac{V_{\text{rms}}}{Z} = \frac{50}{500} = 0.1 \, \text{A}
\]

The PD across the capacitor \(V_C\) is:
\[
V_C = I \times X_C = 0.1 \times 400 = 40 \, \text{V}
\]

\subsubsection*{(b) Mean Rate of Energy Supplied by the Source}

The mean power \(P\) supplied by the source is given by:
\[

\section*{Problem Statement}

A \(3 \, \Omega\) resistor is joined in series with a \(10 \, \text{mH}\) inductor of negligible resistance, and a potential difference (rms) of \(5.0 \, \text{V}\) alternating at \(\frac{200}{\pi} \, \text{Hz}\) is applied across the combination. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Calculate the potential difference \(V_R\) across the resistor and \(V_L\) across the inductor.
    \item[(b)] Determine the phase difference between the applied potential difference and the current.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Potential Differences Across the Resistor and Inductor}

Given:
\begin{align*}
    R &= 3 \, \Omega, \\
    L &= 10 \, \text{mH} = 10 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{H}, \\
    V_{\text{rms}} &= 5.0 \, \text{V}, \\
    f &= \frac{200}{\pi} \, \text{Hz}.
\end{align*}

The angular frequency \(\omega\) is given by:
\[
\omega = 2 \pi f = 2 \pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right) = 400 \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

The inductive reactance \(X_L\) is:
\[
X_L = \omega L = 400 \times 10 \times 10^{-3} = 4 \, \Omega.
\]

The impedance \(Z\) of the series R-L circuit is:
\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X_L^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5 \, \Omega.
\]

The current \(I\) (rms) in the circuit is:
\[
I = \frac{V_{\text{rms}}}{Z} = \frac{5.0}{5} = 1.0 \, \text{A}.
\]

The potential difference across the resistor \(V_R\) is:
\[
V_R = I \cdot R = 1.0 \times 3 = 3.0 \, \text{V}.
\]

The potential difference across the inductor \(V_L\) is:
\[
V_L = I \cdot X_L = 1.0 \times 4 = 4.0 \, \text{V}.
\]

\subsection*{(b) Phase Difference}

The phase difference \(\phi\) between the applied potential difference and the current is given by:
\[
\tan \phi = \frac{X_L}{R} = \frac{4}{3}.
\]

Thus, the phase difference \(\phi\) is:
\[
\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right).

14.3,"To solve this problem, we start with the formula for the energy stored in an inductor:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} L I^2
\]

where:
- \( E \) is the energy stored in the inductor (in joules),
- \( L \) is the inductance (in henrys),
- \( I \) is the current (in amperes).

Given:
- \( E = 10 \, \text{J} \)
- \( I = 5 \, \text{A} \)

We need to find the inductance \( L \). Rearrange the formula to solve for \( L \):

\[
L = \frac{2E}{I^2}
\]

Substitute the given values into the equation:

\[
L = \frac{2 \times 10 \, \text{J}}{(5 \, \text{A})^2}
\]

Calculate:

\[
L = \frac{20}{25} = 0.8 \, \text{H}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( E \) is the energy stored in the inductor (in joules),

Calculate:

\[
L = \frac{20}{25} = 0.8 \, \text{H}

A tuning circuit in a radio transmitter has a \SI{4e-6}{\henry} inductance in series with a \SI{5e-11}{\farad} capacitance. Find:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the frequency of the waves transmitted.
    \item their wavelength.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Frequency of the Waves Transmitted}

The resonant frequency \( f \) of an LC circuit is given by the formula:
\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{LC}}
\]
where \( L = \SI{4e-6}{\henry} \) and \( C = \SI{5e-11}{\farad} \).

\section*{Problem}

At 600 Hz, an inductor and a capacitor have equal reactances. Calculate the ratio of the capacitive reactance to the inductive reactance at 60 Hz.

\section*{Solution}

The reactance of an inductor (\(X_L\)) and a capacitor (\(X_C\)) are given by:

\[
X_L = 2\pi f L
\]

\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
\]

where \(f\) is the frequency, \(L\) is the inductance, and \(C\) is the capacitance.

Given that at 600 Hz, the inductive and capacitive reactances are equal:

\[
X_L = X_C \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2\pi \times 600 \times L = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 600 \times C}
\]

Solving for \(L\) and \(C\), we have:

\[
L = \frac{1}{(2\pi \times 600)^2 \times C}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the ratio of the capacitive reactance to the inductive reactance at 60 Hz:

\[
X_{C_{60}} = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 60 \times C}
\]

\[
X_{L_{60}} = 2\pi \times 60 \times L
\]

Substituting \(L\) from the earlier equation:

\[
X_{L_{60}} = 2\pi \times 60 \times \frac{1}{(2\pi \times 600)^2 \times C}
\]

Now, the ratio \(\frac{X_{C_{60}}}{X_{L_{60}}}\) is:

\[
\frac{X_{C_{60}}}{X_{L_{60}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2\pi \times 60 \times C}}{2\pi \times 60 \times \frac{1}{(2\pi \times 600)^2 \times C}}
\]

Simplifying the expression:

\[
= \frac{1}{(2\pi \times 60)^2} \times (2\pi \times 600)^2
\]

\[
= \left(\frac{600}{60}\right)^2
\]

\[
= 100
\]

Therefore, the ratio of the capacitive reactance to the inductive reactance at 60 Hz is \(\boxed{100}\).

    \item[(c)] What is the rms current, if it is connected to a \SI{220}{\volt} \SI{50}{\hertz} line?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Find the Capacitance}

The reactance \(X_C\) of a capacitor is given by the formula:
\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
\]
where \(f\) is the frequency and \(C\) is the capacitance. Given that \(X_C = 4 \, \Omega\) at \(f = \SI{250}{\hertz}\), we can solve for \(C\):
\[
4 = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 250 \times C}
\]
\[
C = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 250 \times 4}
\]
\[
C \approx \SI{159.15}{\micro\farad}
\]

Using the capacitance found in part (a), calculate the reactance at \SI{100}{\hertz}:
\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 100 \times C}
\]
Substituting \(C \approx \SI{159.15}{\micro\farad}\):
\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 100 \times 159.15 \times 10^{-6}}
\]
\[
X_C \approx \SI{10}{\ohm}
\]

\subsection*{(c) RMS Current with a \SI{220}{\volt} \SI{50}{\hertz} Line}

First, calculate the reactance at \SI{50}{\hertz}:
\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 50 \times C}
\]
\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 50 \times 159.15 \times 10^{-6}}
\]
\[
X_C \approx \SI{20}{\ohm}
\]

\[
I_{\text{rms}} = \frac{V_{\text{rms}}}{X_C}
\]
where \(V_{\text{rms}} = \SI{220}{\volt}\):

I_{\text{rms}} = \SI{11}{\ampere}

\section*{Problem}

When an impedance, consisting of an inductance $L$ and a resistance $R$ in series, is connected across a \SI{12}{\volt}, \SI{50}{\hertz} supply, a current of \SI{0.05}{\ampere} flows which differs in phase from that of the applied potential difference by \ang{60}. Find the value of $R$ and $L$. Find the capacitance of the capacitor which when connected in series in the above circuit has the effect of bringing the current into phase with the applied potential difference. [University of London]

\section*{Solution}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supply voltage, $V = \SI{12}{\volt}$
    \item Frequency, $f = \SI{50}{\hertz}$
    \item Current, $I = \SI{0.05}{\ampere}$
    \item Phase difference, $\phi = \ang{60}$
\end{itemize}

The impedance $Z$ of the series circuit is given by:
\[
Z = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{\SI{12}{\volt}}{\SI{0.05}{\ampere}} = \SI{240}{\ohm}
\]

The phase angle $\phi$ is given by:
\[
\tan \phi = \frac{\omega L}{R}
\]
where $\omega = 2 \pi f = 2 \pi \times \SI{50}{\hertz}$.

Given $\phi = \ang{60}$, we have:
\[
\tan \ang{60} = \sqrt{3} = \frac{\omega L}{R}
\]

The magnitude of the impedance is:
\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (\omega L)^2}
\]

Substituting $Z = \SI{240}{\ohm}$, we have:
\[
240 = \sqrt{R^2 + (\omega L)^2}
\]

Solving the equations:
\[
R = \frac{\omega L}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
\[
240 = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\omega L}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 + (\omega L)^2}
\]

Now, let's find the capacitance $C$ that brings the current into phase with the voltage. The condition for resonance in an RLC series circuit is:
\[
\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}
\]

Thus, the capacitance $C$ is given by:
\[
C = \frac{1}{\omega^2 L}
\]

Substitute the value of $L$ obtained from the previous calculations to find $C$.

When a 0.6 H inductor is connected to a 220 V 50 Hz AC line, what is (a) the rms current and (b) peak current?

Given:

    \item Voltage, $V_{\text{rms}} = 220\, \text{V}$
    \item Frequency, $f = 50\, \text{Hz}$
\end{itemize}

The inductive reactance $X_L$ is given by:
\[
X_L = 2 \pi f L
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
X_L = 2 \pi \times 50 \times 0.6 = 60 \pi\, \Omega
\]

(a) The rms current $I_{\text{rms}}$ can be calculated using Ohm's Law for AC circuits:
\[
I_{\text{rms}} = \frac{V_{\text{rms}}}{X_L}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
I_{\text{rms}} = \frac{220}{60 \pi} \approx 1.166\, \text{A}
\]

(b) The peak current $I_{\text{peak}}$ is related to the rms current by the following relation:
\[
I_{\text{peak}} = I_{\text{rms}} \times \sqrt{2}
\]

Substitute the value of $I_{\text{rms}}$:
\[
I_{\text{peak}} = 1.166 \times \sqrt{2} \approx 1.649\, \text{A}
\]

Thus, the rms current is approximately $1.166\, \text{A}$ and the peak current is approximately $1.649\, \text{A}$.

    \item the rms potential difference across each component.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) RMS Current Flowing}

The impedance $Z$ of the series circuit is given by:
\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (X_L)^2}
\]
where $X_L = \omega L$ is the inductive reactance, and $\omega = 2\pi f$ is the angular frequency. Given $f = 50 \, \text{Hz}$, $R = 4.0 \, \Omega$, and $L = 0.01 \, \text{H}$, we have:
\[
\omega = 2\pi \times 50 = 100\pi \, \text{rad/s}

\[
P = I_{\text{rms}}^2 R

Substituting the expression for $I_{\text{rms}}$:
\[
P = \left(\frac{24}{\sqrt{4.0^2 + \pi^2}}\right)^2 \times 4.0 \, \text{W}

\section*{Problem}

An AC circuit consists of only a resistor $R = 100 \, \Omega$ and a source voltage $V = 0.5 \, V_m$ at time $t = \frac{1}{360} \, \text{s}$. Assuming that at $t = 0$, $V = 0$, find the frequency.

\section*{Solution}

The voltage in an AC circuit can be expressed as:
\[
V(t) = V_m \sin(2 \pi f t)
\]

Given that $V = 0.5 \, V_m$ at $t = \frac{1}{360} \, \text{s}$, we can write:
\[
0.5 \, V_m = V_m \sin\left(2 \pi f \cdot \frac{1}{360}\right)
\]

Dividing both sides by $V_m$, we get:
\[
0.5 = \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi f}{360}\right)
\]

The sine of $\frac{\pi}{6}$ is $0.5$, so:
\[
\frac{2 \pi f}{360} = \frac{\pi}{6}
\]

Solving for $f$, we have:
\[
2 \pi f = \frac{\pi}{6} \times 360
\]

\[
2 \pi f = 60 \pi
\]

\[
f = \frac{60 \pi}{2 \pi} = 30

Thus, the frequency of the AC circuit is $f = 30 \, \text{Hz}$.

    \item[(a)] $RC$
    \item[(b)] $\frac{L}{R}$
    \item[(c)] $\sqrt{LC}$
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

To show that each expression has the units of time, we will analyze the units of resistance ($R$), capacitance ($C$), and inductance ($L$).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Resistance, $R$, has units of ohms ($\Omega$), which can be expressed in terms of fundamental units as $\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-3} \cdot \text{A}^{-2}$.
    \item Capacitance, $C$, has units of farads (F), which can be expressed as $\text{s}^4 \cdot \text{A}^2 \cdot \text{m}^{-2} \cdot \text{kg}^{-1}$.
    \item Inductance, $L$, has units of henrys (H), which can be expressed as $\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2} \cdot \text{A}^{-2}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{(a) $RC$}

The units of $RC$ are given by:
\[
RC = \left( \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-3} \cdot \text{A}^{-2} \right) \left( \text{s}^4 \cdot \text{A}^2 \cdot \text{m}^{-2} \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \right)
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
RC = \text{s}
\]

Thus, $RC$ has the units of time.

\subsection*{(b) $\frac{L}{R}$}

The units of $\frac{L}{R}$ are given by:
\[
\frac{L}{R} = \frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2} \cdot \text{A}^{-2}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-3} \cdot \text{A}^{-2}}
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{L}{R} = \text{s}
\]

Thus, $\frac{L}{R}$ has the units of time.

\subsection*{(c) $\sqrt{LC}$}

The units of $\sqrt{LC}$ are given by:
\[
\sqrt{LC} = \sqrt{\left( \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2} \cdot \text{A}^{-2} \right) \left( \text{s}^4 \cdot \text{A}^2 \cdot \text{m}^{-2} \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \right)}
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
\sqrt{LC} = \sqrt{\text{s}^2} = \text{s}
\]

Thus, $\sqrt{LC}$ has the units of time.

\section*{Problem}

In an oscillating RLC circuit, the amplitude of the charge oscillations drops to one-half its initial value in 4 cycles. Show that the fractional decrement of the resonance frequency is approximately given by:

\[
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega} \approx 0.00038
\]

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we start by considering the damped oscillations in an RLC circuit. The amplitude \( A(t) \) of the charge oscillations can be described by:

\[
A(t) = A_0 e^{-\gamma t}
\]

where \( A_0 \) is the initial amplitude, and \( \gamma \) is the damping coefficient. Given that the amplitude drops to half its initial value in 4 cycles, we have:

\[
A(4T) = \frac{A_0}{2}
\]

where \( T \) is the period of one cycle. Substituting into the amplitude equation:

\[
A_0 e^{-\gamma \cdot 4T} = \frac{A_0}{2}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
e^{-\gamma \cdot 4T} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\gamma \cdot 4T = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

\[
\gamma = -\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{4T}
\]

The resonance frequency \( \omega_0 \) of the undamped circuit is related to the damped frequency \( \omega \) by:

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}
\]

For small damping, \( \gamma \ll \omega_0 \), we can approximate:

\[
\omega \approx \omega_0 \left(1 - \frac{\gamma^2}{2\omega_0^2}\right)
\]

The fractional decrement of the resonance frequency is:

\[
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} \approx \frac{\gamma^2}{2\omega_0^2}
\]

Substituting the expression for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} \approx \frac{\left(-\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{4T}\right)^2}{2\omega_0^2}
\]

Given that \( T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_0} \), substitute \( T \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} \approx \frac{\left(\frac{\ln(2)}{4 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{\omega_0}}\right)^2}{2\omega_0^2}
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} \approx \frac{\left(\frac{\ln(2) \cdot \omega_0}{8\pi}\right)^2}{2\omega_0^2}
\]

\[
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} \approx \frac{\ln(2)^2}{128\pi^2}
\]

Calculating this value gives approximately:

\[
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} \approx 0.00038
\]

Thus, the fractional decrement of the resonance frequency is approximately \( 0.00038 \).

14.16,"To derive the equation for the current in a damped LC circuit with low damping, we start with the differential equation that describes the circuit. A damped LC circuit can be modeled by the following second-order linear differential equation:

\[
L \frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + R \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{q}{C} = 0
\]

where:
- \( L \) is the inductance,
- \( R \) is the resistance,
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( q(t) \) is the charge on the capacitor at time \( t \).

For low damping, the resistance \( R \) is small, and the system is underdamped. The solution to this differential equation is of the form:

\[
q(t) = Q e^{-\alpha t} \cos(\omega_d t + \phi)
\]

where:
- \( Q \) is the maximum charge,
- \( \alpha = \frac{R}{2L} \) is the damping factor,
- \( \omega_d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC} - \left(\frac{R}{2L}\right)^2} \) is the damped angular frequency,
- \( \phi \) is the phase constant.

The current \( i(t) \) in the circuit is the time derivative of the charge:

\[
i(t) = \frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( Q e^{-\alpha t} \cos(\omega_d t + \phi) \right)
\]

Applying the product rule and chain rule, we get:

\[
i(t) = Q \left( -\alpha e^{-\alpha t} \cos(\omega_d t + \phi) - \omega_d e^{-\alpha t} \sin(\omega_d t + \phi) \right)
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
i(t) = Q e^{-\alpha t} \left( -\alpha \cos(\omega_d t + \phi) - \omega_d \sin(\omega_d t + \phi) \right)
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
i(t) = Q e^{-\alpha t} \left( \omega_d \sin(\omega_d t + \phi + \theta) \right)
\]

where \( \theta \) is a phase shift to account for the initial conditions. The expression for \( \theta \) can be determined based on the initial conditions of the circuit.

Thus, the current in a damped LC circuit for low damping is given by:

\[
i(t) = I_0 e^{-\alpha t} \sin(\omega_d t + \theta)
\]

where \( I_0 \) is the maximum current, determined by the initial conditions of the circuit."

\section*{RC Circuit in Series}

Consider an RC circuit in series, consisting of a resistor \( R \) and a capacitor \( C \), connected to a voltage source \( V(t) \).

The voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm's Law:
\[
V_R(t) = i(t)R
\]

The voltage across the capacitor is given by the relationship:
\[
V_C(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int i(t) \, dt
\]

The total voltage in the circuit is the sum of the voltages across the resistor and the capacitor:
\[
V(t) = V_R(t) + V_C(t) = i(t)R + \frac{1}{C} \int i(t) \, dt
\]

\subsection*{Power Analysis}

The power delivered to the resistor is:
\[
P_R(t) = i(t)V_R(t) = i(t)^2 R
\]

The power delivered to the capacitor is:
\[
P_C(t) = i(t)V_C(t) = i(t) \left( \frac{1}{C} \int i(t) \, dt \right)
\]

The input power from the source is:
\[
P_{\text{in}}(t) = i(t)V(t) = i(t) \left( i(t)R + \frac{1}{C} \int i(t) \, dt \right)
\]

Simplifying, we find:
\[
P_{\text{in}}(t) = i(t)^2 R + i(t) \left( \frac{1}{C} \int i(t) \, dt \right)
\]

Thus, the input power is indeed the sum of the powers delivered to the resistor and the capacitor:
\[
P_{\text{in}}(t) = P_R(t) + P_C(t)
\]

This shows that the input power is the sum of the powers delivered to the resistor and the capacitor in an RC circuit in series.

\section*{RLC Circuit in Parallel}

Consider a parallel RLC circuit consisting of a resistor \( R \), an inductor \( L \), and a capacitor \( C \). The voltage across each component is the same, denoted by \( V(t) \). The current through each component can be described as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The current through the resistor is \( I_R(t) = \frac{V(t)}{R} \).
    \item The current through the inductor is \( I_L(t) = \frac{1}{L} \int V(t) \, dt \).
    \item The current through the capacitor is \( I_C(t) = C \frac{dV(t)}{dt} \).
\end{itemize}

The total current \( I(t) \) in the circuit is the sum of the currents through each component:

\begin{equation}
    I(t) = I_R(t) + I_L(t) + I_C(t) = \frac{V(t)}{R} + \frac{1}{L} \int V(t) \, dt + C \frac{dV(t)}{dt}.
\end{equation}

Applying Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) to the parallel RLC circuit, we have:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{V(t)}{R} + \frac{1}{L} \int V(t) \, dt + C \frac{dV(t)}{dt} = I(t).
\end{equation}

To show that the Joule heat in the resistor comes from the energy stored in the inductor and capacitor, we consider the energy balance in the circuit. The energy stored in the inductor \( W_L \) and the capacitor \( W_C \) are given by:

\begin{equation}
    W_L = \frac{1}{2} L I_L^2(t),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    W_C = \frac{1}{2} C V^2(t).
\end{equation}

The rate of change of energy stored in the inductor and capacitor is:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dW_L}{dt} = L I_L(t) \frac{dI_L(t)}{dt},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dW_C}{dt} = C V(t) \frac{dV(t)}{dt}.
\end{equation}

The power dissipated as Joule heat in the resistor is:

\begin{equation}
    P_R = I_R^2(t) R = \left(\frac{V(t)}{R}\right)^2 R = \frac{V^2(t)}{R}.
\end{equation}

The energy conservation in the circuit implies:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dW_L}{dt} + \frac{dW_C}{dt} = -P_R.
\end{equation}

This equation shows that the rate of decrease of energy stored in the inductor and capacitor is equal to the power dissipated as Joule heat in the resistor, thus demonstrating that the Joule heat in the resistor comes from the energy stored in the inductor and capacitor.

For the electrical circuit shown below, when the switch $K$ is closed, the charge and current are observed to oscillate (Fig. 14.2). Show that the differential equation governing the charge of the system can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2Q}{dt^2} + 2\gamma \frac{dQ}{dt} + \omega_0^2 Q = 0
\end{equation}

where $\gamma$ and $\omega_0^2$ are to be determined in terms of the capacitance $C$, inductance $L$, and resistance $R$.

For a resistance $R = 100 \, \Omega$, capacitance $C = 700 \, \text{pF}$, and inductance $L = 80 \, \text{mH}$, calculate:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] The natural frequency, $f_0$, of the oscillation.
    \item[(b)] The time constant, $\tau$, for the decay.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution:}

The differential equation for an RLC circuit is given by:

\begin{equation}
    L \frac{d^2Q}{dt^2} + R \frac{dQ}{dt} + \frac{Q}{C} = 0
\end{equation}

Comparing this with the standard form:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2Q}{dt^2} + 2\gamma \frac{dQ}{dt} + \omega_0^2 Q = 0
\end{equation}

we identify:

\begin{align*}
    2\gamma &= \frac{R}{L} \\
    \omega_0^2 &= \frac{1}{LC}
\end{align*}

Substituting the given values:

\begin{align*}
    R &= 100 \, \Omega \\
    C &= 700 \, \text{pF} = 700 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F} \\
    L &= 80 \, \text{mH} = 80 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{H}

Calculate $\gamma$ and $\omega_0$:

\begin{align*}
    \gamma &= \frac{R}{2L} = \frac{100}{2 \times 80 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{100}{160 \times 10^{-3}} = 625 \, \text{s}^{-1} \\
    \omega_0 &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{80 \times 10^{-3} \times 700 \times 10^{-12}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{56 \times 10^{-12}}} \approx 13333 \, \text{rad/s}

(a) The natural frequency $f_0$ is given by:

- \( c \) is the damping coefficient,
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x(t) \) is the displacement as a function of time.

The solution to this second-order linear differential equation depends on the discriminant \(\Delta = c^2 - 4mk\). We consider three cases based on the value of \(\Delta\):

1. **Overdamped (\(\Delta > 0\)):**
   \[
   x(t) = e^{-\frac{c}{2m}t} \left( C_1 e^{\frac{\sqrt{c^2 - 4mk}}{2m}t} + C_2 e^{-\frac{\sqrt{c^2 - 4mk}}{2m}t} \right)

2. **Critically damped (\(\Delta = 0\)):**
   \[
   x(t) = \left( C_1 + C_2 t \right) e^{-\frac{c}{2m}t}
   \]

3. **Underdamped (\(\Delta < 0\)):**

A \(4 \, \Omega\) resistor and a \(50 \, \mu\mathrm{F}\) capacitor are connected in series, and an AC source of \(5 \, \mathrm{V}\) at \(300 \, \mathrm{Hz}\) is applied. What is the magnitude of the current flowing through the circuit? [University of Manchester 2007]

\section*{Solution}

First, we calculate the capacitive reactance \(X_C\) of the capacitor using the formula:
\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
\]
where \(f = 300 \, \mathrm{Hz}\) and \(C = 50 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{F}\).

\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 300 \times 50 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 0.015} \approx 10.61 \, \Omega
\]

The total impedance \(Z\) of the series circuit is given by:
\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X_C^2}
\]
where \(R = 4 \, \Omega\).

\[
Z = \sqrt{4^2 + 10.61^2} = \sqrt{16 + 112.5721} \approx \sqrt{128.5721} \approx 11.34 \, \Omega
\]

Using Ohm's law, the magnitude of the current \(I\) is:
\[
I = \frac{V}{Z}
\]
where \(V = 5 \, \mathrm{V}\).

\[
I = \frac{5}{11.34} \approx 0.441 \, \mathrm{A}

\mathbf{J} = \frac{I}{A}
\]
where \( A \) is the area through which the current flows.

\subsection*{(b) Quantization of Charge}

When we say that a quantity of charge is quantized, we mean that charge exists in discrete packets rather than a continuous distribution. The fundamental unit of charge is the charge of an electron, \( e \), which is approximately \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). Thus, any charge \( Q \) can be expressed as:
\[
Q = n \cdot e
\]
where \( n \) is an integer.

\subsection*{(c) Copper Bar Problem}

Consider a copper bar with a rectangular cross-section of width \( w = 5.6 \, \text{mm} \) and height \( h = 50 \, \mu\text{m} \). The electron density is \( n = 8.5 \times 10^{28} \, \text{m}^{-3} \). A uniform current of \( i = 2.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{A} \) flows through the strip.

\subsubsection*{(i) Magnitude of the Current Density}

The area \( A \) of the cross-section is:
\[
A = w \times h = (5.6 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}) \times (50 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}) = 2.8 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^2
\]

The current density \( \mathbf{J} \) is:
\[
\mathbf{J} = \frac{i}{A} = \frac{2.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{A}}{2.8 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^2} = 8.57 \times 10^{2} \, \text{A/m}^2
\]

\subsubsection*{(ii) Magnitude of the Drift Speed}

The drift speed \( v_d \) is given by:
\[
v_d = \frac{i}{n \cdot e \cdot A}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
v_d = \frac{2.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{A}}{(8.5 \times 10^{28} \, \text{m}^{-3}) \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}) \times 2.8 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^2}
\]
\[
v_d \approx 6.34 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m/s}
\]

\subsubsection*{(iii) Explanation of High Current with Small Drift Speed}

The current is relatively high despite the small drift speed because of the high electron density in the copper. The large number of charge carriers per unit volume compensates for the slow movement of individual electrons, resulting in a substantial total current.

14.25,"To show that two series resonant circuits with component values \(L_1, C_1\) and \(L_2, C_2\) respectively have the same resonant frequency when connected in series, we start by considering the resonant frequency of a series LC circuit. The resonant frequency \(f_0\) is given by:

\[
f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}
\]

For the first circuit with \(L_1\) and \(C_1\), the resonant frequency \(f_{01}\) is:

\[
f_{01} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{L_1 C_1}}
\]

For the second circuit with \(L_2\) and \(C_2\), the resonant frequency \(f_{02}\) is:

\[
f_{02} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{L_2 C_2}}
\]

Given that both circuits have the same resonant frequency, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{L_1 C_1}} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{L_2 C_2}}
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain:

\[
L_1 C_1 = L_2 C_2
\]

When these circuits are connected in series, the total inductance \(L_t\) and capacitance \(C_t\) of the combined circuit are:

\[
L_t = L_1 + L_2
\]
\[
C_t = \frac{C_1 C_2}{C_1 + C_2}
\]

The resonant frequency \(f_{0t}\) of the combined circuit is:

\[
f_{0t} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{L_t C_t}}
\]

Substituting for \(L_t\) and \(C_t\), we have:

\[
f_{0t} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{(L_1 + L_2) \left(\frac{C_1 C_2}{C_1 + C_2}\right)}}
\]

Simplifying the expression under the square root:

\[
f_{0t} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\frac{(L_1 + L_2) C_1 C_2}{C_1 + C_2}}}
\]

Since \(L_1 C_1 = L_2 C_2\), we can write:

\[
L_1 C_1 = L_2 C_2 = k \quad \text{(some constant)}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
f_{0t} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\frac{k(C_1 + C_2)}{C_1 + C_2}}} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{k}}
\]

This is the same as the original resonant frequency \(f_{01}\) or \(f_{02}\), confirming that the combined circuit has the same resonant frequency. Therefore, the combination of the two series resonant circuits retains the same resonant frequency."

\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

An inductance and condenser in series have a capacitive impedance of $500 \, \Omega$ at $1 \, \text{kHz}$ and an inductive impedance of $100 \, \Omega$ at $5 \, \text{kHz}$. Find the values of inductance and capacitance.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we need to use the formulas for capacitive and inductive reactance:

\begin{align*}
    X_C &= \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}, \\
    X_L &= 2 \pi f L,
\end{align*}

where $X_C$ is the capacitive reactance, $X_L$ is the inductive reactance, $f$ is the frequency, $C$ is the capacitance, and $L$ is the inductance.

Given:
\begin{align*}
    X_C &= 500 \, \Omega \quad \text{at} \quad f = 1 \, \text{kHz}, \\
    X_L &= 100 \, \Omega \quad \text{at} \quad f = 5 \, \text{kHz}.
\end{align*}

First, calculate the capacitance $C$:
\begin{align*}
    500 &= \frac{1}{2 \pi (1 \times 10^3) C}, \\
    C &= \frac{1}{2 \pi (1 \times 10^3) \cdot 500}.
\end{align*}

Now, calculate the inductance $L$:
\begin{align*}
    100 &= 2 \pi (5 \times 10^3) L, \\
    L &= \frac{100}{2 \pi (5 \times 10^3)}.
\end{align*}

Thus, the values of inductance and capacitance are:
\begin{align*}
    C &= \frac{1}{2 \pi \times 10^3 \times 500} \, \text{F}, \\
    L &= \frac{100}{2 \pi \times 5 \times 10^3} \, \text{H}.

\section*{Problem}

A condenser of $0.01 \, \mu\text{F}$ is charged to $100 \, \text{V}$. Calculate the peak current that flows when the charged condenser is connected across an inductance of $10 \, \text{mH}$. [University of Manchester 1972]

\section*{Solution}

The peak current in an LC circuit can be calculated using the formula for the resonant angular frequency $\omega_0$ and the maximum current $I_{\text{max}}$:

\[
\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
\]

where:
\begin{align*}
L &= 10 \, \text{mH} = 10 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{H}, \\
C &= 0.01 \, \mu\text{F} = 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}.
\end{align*}

Substituting the values of $L$ and $C$ into the formula for $\omega_0$:

\[
\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(10 \times 10^{-3}) \times (0.01 \times 10^{-6})}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10^{-10}}} = 10^5 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

The peak current $I_{\text{max}}$ is given by:

\[
I_{\text{max}} = C \cdot V \cdot \omega_0
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
I_{\text{max}} = (0.01 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 100 \cdot 10^5 = 0.01 \, \text{A} = 10 \, \text{mA}
\]

Therefore, the peak current that flows is $10 \, \text{mA}$.

14.28,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the values of resistance \( R \) and capacitance \( C \) that, when placed in series with the given inductance \( L \), result in a resonant circuit with a specified resonant frequency and quality factor \( Q \).

A parallel resonant circuit consists of a coil with inductance \( L = \SI{1}{\milli\henry} \) and resistance \( R = \SI{10}{\ohm} \) in parallel with a capacitance \( C = \SI{0.0005}{\micro\farad} \). Calculate the resonant frequency and the quality factor \( Q \) of the circuit.

\section*{Solution}

The resonant frequency \( f_0 \) of a parallel LC circuit is given by the formula:

Substituting the given values:

\[
L = \SI{1}{\milli\henry} = \SI{1e-3}{\henry}, \quad C = \SI{0.0005}{\micro\farad} = \SI{0.5e-9}{\farad}

\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

A condenser of \SI{10}{\micro\farad} capacitance is charged to \SI{3000}{\volt} and then discharged through a resistor of \SI{10000}{\ohm}. If the resistor has a temperature coefficient of \SI{0.004}{/\degreeCelsius} and a thermal capacity of \SI{0.9}{\calorie/\degreeCelsius}, find:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] the time taken for the voltage on the condenser to fall to $1/e$ of its initial value;
    \item[(b)] the percentage error which would have been introduced if thermal effects had been ignored.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Time Constant Calculation}

The time constant $\tau$ for an RC circuit is given by:
\[
\tau = R \cdot C
\]
where $R = \SI{10000}{\ohm}$ and $C = \SI{10}{\micro\farad} = \SI{10e-6}{\farad}$.

\[
\tau = \SI{10000}{\ohm} \times \SI{10e-6}{\farad} = \SI{0.1}{\second}
\]

The voltage $V(t)$ across the capacitor as a function of time is given by:
\[
V(t) = V_0 e^{-t/\tau}
\]
where $V_0 = \SI{3000}{\volt}$.

To find the time $t$ when the voltage falls to $1/e$ of its initial value:
\[
V(t) = \frac{V_0}{e} \Rightarrow e^{-t/\tau} = \frac{1}{e}
\]
\[
t = \tau = \SI{0.1}{\second}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Percentage Error Due to Ignoring Thermal Effects}

The resistance $R$ changes with temperature, which affects the time constant. The change in resistance $\Delta R$ due to a temperature change $\Delta T$ is given by:
\[
\Delta R = R \cdot \alpha \cdot \Delta T
\]
where $\alpha = \SI{0.004}{/\degreeCelsius}$.

The energy dissipated in the resistor is:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} C V_0^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \SI{10e-6}{\farad} \times (\SI{3000}{\volt})^2 = \SI{45}{\joule}
\]

Converting energy to calories (since \SI{1}{\joule} = \SI{0.239}{\calorie}):
\[
E = \SI{45}{\joule} \times \SI{0.239}{\calorie/\joule} = \SI{10.755}{\calorie}
\]

The temperature rise $\Delta T$ is:
\[
\Delta T = \frac{E}{C_{\text{thermal}}} = \frac{\SI{10.755}{\calorie}}{\SI{0.9}{\calorie/\degreeCelsius}} \approx \SI{11.95}{\degreeCelsius}
\]

The change in resistance $\Delta R$ is:
\[
\Delta R = \SI{10000}{\ohm} \times \SI{0.004}{/\degreeCelsius} \times \SI{11.95}{\degreeCelsius} \approx \SI{478}{\ohm}
\]

The new resistance $R'$ is:
\[
R' = R + \Delta R = \SI{10000}{\ohm} + \SI{478}{\ohm} = \SI{10478}{\ohm}
\]

The new time constant $\tau'$ is:
\[
\tau' = R' \cdot C = \SI{10478}{\ohm} \times \SI{10e-6}{\farad} \approx \SI{0"
14.32,"To show that the fractional half-width of the resonance curve of an RLC circuit is given by \(\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{Q}\), where \(Q\) is the quality factor given by \(Q = \frac{\omega L}{R}\), we start by considering the resonance characteristics of an RLC circuit.

The quality factor \(Q\) is defined as:

\[
Q = \frac{\omega_0 L}{R}
\]

where \(\omega_0\) is the resonant angular frequency, \(L\) is the inductance, and \(R\) is the resistance.

The bandwidth \(\Delta \omega\) of the resonance curve is related to the quality factor by:

\[
\Delta \omega = \frac{\omega_0}{Q}
\]

The fractional half-width is given by:

\[
\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega_0} = \frac{1}{Q}
\]

To show that \(\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{Q}\), we need to consider the specific conditions under which this relation holds, typically involving the analysis of the circuit's response at frequencies around \(\omega_0\).

For a more detailed derivation, one would analyze the impedance of the RLC circuit and its frequency response. However, the given result suggests a specific scenario or approximation, such as a particular definition of the half-width at a certain power level (e.g., \(-3 \, \text{dB}\) point).

### Maxwell’s Equations, Electromagnetic Waves, Poynting Vector

Maxwell's equations describe the fundamentals of electromagnetism and are given by:

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity:**
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
   \]

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:**
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
   \]

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction:**
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
   \]

4. **Ampère-Maxwell Law:**
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
   \]

Electromagnetic waves are solutions to these equations in free space, leading to wave equations for electric and magnetic fields.

The Poynting vector \(\mathbf{S}\) represents the power per unit area carried by an electromagnetic wave and is given by:

\[
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}
\]

where \(\mathbf{E}\) is the electric field and \(\mathbf{H}\) is the magnetic field intensity.

These concepts form the foundation for understanding electromagnetic wave propagation, energy transfer, and resonance phenomena in circuits."

A plane electromagnetic wave is given by the electric field:

E = 100 \cos(6 \times 10^8 t + 4x) \, \text{V/m}
\]
propagates in a medium. What is the dielectric constant of the medium? [Indian Administrative Services]

\section*{Solution}

To find the dielectric constant of the medium, we start by identifying the wave number \( k \) and the angular frequency \( \omega \) from the given wave equation:

\[
E = E_0 \cos(\omega t + kx)
\]

Comparing with the given equation:
\[
E = 100 \cos(6 \times 10^8 t + 4x) \, \text{V/m}
\]

we find:
\[
\omega = 6 \times 10^8 \, \text{rad/s}, \quad k = 4 \, \text{m}^{-1}
\]

The wave number \( k \) is related to the wavelength \( \lambda \) by:
\[
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
\]

The speed of the wave \( v \) in the medium is given by:
\[
v = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{6 \times 10^8}{4} = 1.5 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

The speed of light in a medium is related to the speed of light in vacuum \( c \) and the refractive index \( n \) by:
\[
v = \frac{c}{n}
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Thus:
\[
n = \frac{c}{v} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{1.5 \times 10^8} = 2
\]

The refractive index \( n \) is related to the dielectric constant \( \varepsilon_r \) by:
\[
n = \sqrt{\varepsilon_r}
\]

Thus, the dielectric constant \( \varepsilon_r \) is:
\[
\varepsilon_r = n^2 = 2^2 = 4
\]

Therefore, the dielectric constant of the medium is \( \varepsilon_r = 4 \).

   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{j} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}

Taking the divergence of both sides of the Ampère-Maxwell law, we have:
\[
\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{B}) = \nabla \cdot \left( \mu_0 \mathbf{j} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right)
\]

Since the divergence of a curl is always zero, the left-hand side becomes:
\[
0 = \nabla \cdot \left( \mu_0 \mathbf{j} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right)
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[
0 = \mu_0 \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \nabla \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\]

Using the continuity equation, which states:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} = -\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}
\]

and substituting Gauss's law:
\[
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E})
\]

Thus, the continuity equation becomes:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} = -\varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E})
\]

Substituting back, we have:
\[
0 = \mu_0 \left( -\varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}) \right) + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \nabla \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
0 = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \left( -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}) + \nabla \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right)
\]

Since both terms cancel each other out, we conclude:
\[
\nabla \cdot \left( \mathbf{j} + \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right) = 0
\]

This completes the proof.

The free-space wave equation for a medium without absorption is given by:

\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = 0
\end{equation}

To show that this equation predicts that electromagnetic waves are propagated with the velocity of light, we start by considering the form of a plane wave solution:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)}
\end{equation}

Substituting this into the wave equation, we have:

\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = -k^2 \mathbf{E}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = -\omega^2 \mathbf{E}
\end{equation}

Substituting these into the wave equation gives:

\begin{equation}
-k^2 \mathbf{E} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \omega^2 \mathbf{E} = 0
\end{equation}

This simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
k^2 = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \omega^2
\end{equation}

The relationship between the wave vector \( \mathbf{k} \) and the angular frequency \( \omega \) for a wave traveling with speed \( c \) is given by:

\begin{equation}
k = \frac{\omega}{c}
\end{equation}

Substituting this into the equation \( k^2 = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \omega^2 \), we get:

\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2 = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \omega^2
\end{equation}

Simplifying, we find:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{c^2} = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0
\end{equation}

Thus, the speed of light \( c \) is given by:

\begin{equation}
c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0}}

This confirms that the wave equation predicts that electromagnetic waves propagate with the speed of light.

\section*{Problem}

Consider an electromagnetic wave with its electric field ($\mathbf{E}$-field) in the $y$-direction. Apply the relation 
\[
\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial t}
\]
to the harmonic wave $E = E_0 \cos(kx - \omega t)$, $B = B_0 \cos(kx - \omega t)$ to show that $E_0 = cB_0$.

\section*{Solution}

Given the electric field $E = E_0 \cos(kx - \omega t)$ and the magnetic field $B = B_0 \cos(kx - \omega t)$, we need to apply the relation:
\[
\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial t}
\]

First, calculate the partial derivative of $E_y$ with respect to $x$:
\[
\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( E_0 \cos(kx - \omega t) \right) = -E_0 k \sin(kx - \omega t)
\]

Next, calculate the partial derivative of $B_z$ with respect to $t$:
\[
\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( B_0 \cos(kx - \omega t) \right) = B_0 \omega \sin(kx - \omega t)
\]

Substitute these expressions into the given relation:
\[
-E_0 k \sin(kx - \omega t) = -B_0 \omega \sin(kx - \omega t)
\]

Since $\sin(kx - \omega t)$ is common and non-zero, we can cancel it from both sides:
\[
-E_0 k = -B_0 \omega
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
E_0 k = B_0 \omega
\]

Using the relation between wave number $k$, angular frequency $\omega$, and the speed of light $c$, where $k = \frac{\omega}{c}$, we substitute:
\[
E_0 \frac{\omega}{c} = B_0 \omega
\]

Cancel $\omega$ from both sides:
\[
E_0 \frac{1}{c} = B_0
\]

Thus, we find:
\[
E_0 = c B_0
\]

This shows that $E_0 = c B_0$, as required.

   \]

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
   \]

3. Faraday's Law of Induction:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}

4. Ampère-Maxwell Law (with conduction current):
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu \mathbf{J} + \mu \varepsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
   \]

In a conducting medium, the current density \(\mathbf{J}\) is given by Ohm's Law:
\[
\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E}
\]

Substituting this into the Ampère-Maxwell Law, we have:
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu \sigma \mathbf{E} + \mu \varepsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\]

Taking the curl of Faraday's Law:
\[
\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\nabla \times \mathbf{B})
\]

Using the vector identity \(\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) = \nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{E}\) and assuming \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0\) for simplicity (or in the absence of free charge), we have:
\[
-\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\mu \sigma \mathbf{E} + \mu \varepsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t})
\]

Simplifying, we obtain the wave equation for the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\):
\[
\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu \sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} + \mu \varepsilon \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}

Similarly, for the magnetic field \(\mathbf{B}\), using the same procedure, we derive:
\[
\nabla^2 \mathbf{B} = \mu \sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} + \mu \varepsilon \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2}

\[
E(r) = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi \varepsilon_0 r}

The magnetic field $B$ in the region $a < r < b$ can be determined using Ampère's law. For a current $I$ flowing through the central wire, the magnetic field is given by:

\[
B(r) = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}
\]

The Poynting vector $S$ represents the power per unit area carried by the electromagnetic field. It is given by:

14.44,"To show that the energy density stored in the electric field is equal to that stored in the magnetic field, we start by considering the expressions for the energy densities of the electric and magnetic fields.

The energy density \( u_E \) stored in the electric field is given by:

u_E = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 E^2
\]

where \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space and \( E \) is the magnitude of the electric field.

For electromagnetic waves in free space, the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields are related by the speed of light \( c \), where \( c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}} \). The relationship between \( E \) and \( B \) is:

\[
E = cB

Substituting \( E = cB \) into the expression for \( u_E \), we get:

\[
u_E = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 (cB)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 c^2 B^2

\section*{Problem}

A proton of kinetic energy \(20 \, \text{MeV}\) circulates in a cyclotron with a \(0.5 \, \text{m}\) radius. Calculate its energy loss to radiation per orbit and show that it is negligible.

\section*{Solution}

The energy loss due to synchrotron radiation for a charged particle like a proton in a magnetic field is given by the formula:

\[
P = \frac{2}{3} \frac{e^2 c \gamma^4 \beta^4}{R^2}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(e\) is the charge of the proton (\(e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\)),
    \item \(c\) is the speed of light (\(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)),
    \item \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}\),
    \item \(\beta = \frac{v}{c}\) is the velocity of the proton as a fraction of the speed of light,
    \item \(R\) is the radius of the cyclotron (\(R = 0.5 \, \text{m}\)).
\end{itemize}

First, calculate \(\beta\) using the kinetic energy:

\[
K = (\gamma - 1) m c^2 = 20 \, \text{MeV}
\]

where \(m\) is the rest mass of the proton (\(m = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\)).

Rearranging the equation for \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma = \frac{K}{m c^2} + 1 = \frac{20 \, \text{MeV}}{938 \, \text{MeV}} + 1 \approx 1.0213
\]

Then, calculate \(\beta\):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{1.0213^2}} \approx 0.204
\]

Now, substitute these values into the power formula:

\[
P = \frac{2}{3} \frac{(1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C})^2 (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) (1.0213)^4 (0.204)^4}{(0.5 \, \text{m})^2}
\]

Calculating \(P\) gives a very small value, indicating that the energy loss per orbit is negligible. The energy loss per orbit is:

\[
E_{\text{loss}} = P \times T
\]

where \(T\) is the period of one orbit:

\[
T = \frac{2 \pi R}{v} = \frac{2 \pi \times 0.5 \, \text{m}}{\beta c}
\]

Substitute \(\beta\) and \(c\) to find \(T\), and then calculate \(E_{\text{loss}}\). The result will show that the energy loss is indeed negligible compared to the kinetic energy of the proton.

A point source radiates equally in all directions. Find the amplitude of the electric field (\(E\)-field) at a distance of 1 meter.

\section*{Solution}

The intensity \(I\) of the radiation from a point source is given by the formula:
\[
I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}
\]
where \(P\) is the power of the source and \(r\) is the distance from the source.

The intensity is also related to the amplitude of the electric field \(E\) by:
\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 c E^2
\]
where \(\varepsilon_0\) is the permittivity of free space and \(c\) is the speed of light in vacuum.

Equating the two expressions for intensity, we have:
\[
\frac{P}{4\pi r^2} = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 c E^2

Solving for \(E\), we find:

E = \sqrt{\frac{2P}{\varepsilon_0 c \cdot 4\pi r^2}}

    Solving for $E_0$, we have:
    \[
    E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2I}{c \varepsilon_0}}

    Substituting the known values:

\section*{Poynting Vector and Time-Averaged Power}

The Poynting vector \(\mathbf{S}\) represents the power per unit area carried by an electromagnetic wave and is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}
\end{equation}

where \(\mathbf{E}\) is the electric field and \(\mathbf{H}\) is the magnetic field. In free space, the magnetic field \(\mathbf{H}\) can be expressed in terms of the magnetic field intensity \(\mathbf{B}\) as:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{H} = \frac{\mathbf{B}}{\mu_0}
\end{equation}

where \(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space. For a plane electromagnetic wave, the relationship between \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{B} = \frac{\mathbf{E}}{c}
\end{equation}

where \(c\) is the speed of light in vacuum. Substituting this into the expression for \(\mathbf{H}\), we have:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{H} = \frac{\mathbf{E}}{\mu_0 c}
\end{equation}

Thus, the Poynting vector becomes:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \left(\frac{\mathbf{E}}{\mu_0 c}\right) = \frac{1}{\mu_0 c} (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{E})
\end{equation}

Since \(\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{E} = 0\) for parallel vectors, we consider the time-averaged Poynting vector \(\langle \mathbf{S} \rangle\), which is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \langle \mathbf{S} \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \frac{E_0^2}{\mu_0 c}
\end{equation}

where \(E_0\) is the amplitude of the electric field. Therefore, the time-averaged power per unit area carried by a plane electromagnetic wave in free space is:

\begin{equation}
    \langle S \rangle = \frac{E_0^2}{2 \mu_0 c}
\end{equation}

This completes the derivation of the time-averaged power per unit area for a plane electromagnetic wave in free space.

14.51,"To convert the given physics text into properly formatted LaTeX, we need to clearly define the electromagnetic wave equation and calculate the irradiance (flux density). Here's the LaTeX code:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

A plane electromagnetic wave is described by the electric field component:
\[
E_x = E_y = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad E_z = 50 \sin \left[ 4\pi \times 10^{14} \left( t - \frac{x}{3 \times 10^8} \right) \right]
\]

To calculate the irradiance (flux density), we use the formula for the intensity \( I \) of an electromagnetic wave:
\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 c E_0^2
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space, \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \),
    \item \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum, \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
    \item \( E_0 \) is the amplitude of the electric field, \( E_0 = 50 \, \text{V/m} \).
\end{itemize}

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \times 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \times 3 \times 10^8 \times (50)^2
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \times 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2500
\]

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \times 6.6375 \times 10^{-3} = 3.31875 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{W/m}^2
\]

Therefore, the irradiance (flux density) of the wave is approximately \( 3.32 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{W/m}^2 \).

14.52,"To show that \(\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}\) is in the same direction as the wave propagates and has magnitude equal to \(|\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}| = \frac{|\mathbf{E}|^2}{\mu_0 c}\), we start by considering the properties of electromagnetic waves.

In free space, electromagnetic waves are described by the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) and the magnetic field \(\mathbf{H}\). These fields are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave propagation, which we denote as \(\mathbf{k}\). The direction of propagation is given by the Poynting vector \(\mathbf{S}\), which is defined as:

\[
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}
\]

The Poynting vector \(\mathbf{S}\) represents the power per unit area carried by the wave and points in the direction of energy propagation. Thus, \(\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}\) is indeed in the same direction as the wave propagation.

Next, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}\). In free space, the relationship between the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\) is given by:

\[
|\mathbf{H}| = \frac{|\mathbf{E}|}{Z_0}
\]

where \(Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\varepsilon_0}} = \mu_0 c\) is the impedance of free space.

The magnitude of the cross product \(|\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}|\) is:

\[
|\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}| = |\mathbf{E}||\mathbf{H}|\sin\theta
\]

Since \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\) are perpendicular, \(\theta = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin\theta = 1\), so:

\[
|\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}| = |\mathbf{E}||\mathbf{H}|
\]

Substituting \(|\mathbf{H}| = \frac{|\mathbf{E}|}{\mu_0 c}\) into the equation, we get:

\[
|\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}| = |\mathbf{E}|\left(\frac{|\mathbf{E}|}{\mu_0 c}\right) = \frac{|\mathbf{E}|^2}{\mu_0 c}
\]

Thus, we have shown that \(\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}\) is in the same direction as the wave propagates and has the magnitude:

\[
|\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}| = \frac{|\mathbf{E}|^2}{\mu_0 c}

An \textbf{radar monitor} measures the speed \( v \) of approaching cars by sending out waves of frequency \( \nu \). If the frequency received is \( \nu' \), find the speed of the car. How would the beat frequency change if the car is receding?

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we use the Doppler effect formula for waves. When a source emits waves of frequency \( \nu \) and the observer (in this case, the radar) receives waves of frequency \( \nu' \), the relationship between these frequencies and the speed of the car \( v \) is given by:

\[
\nu' = \nu \left( \frac{c}{c - v} \right)
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light. Solving for \( v \), we have:

\[
v = c \left( 1 - \frac{\nu}{\nu'} \right)
\]

If the car is receding, the frequency \( \nu' \) received by the radar will be lower than the emitted frequency \( \nu \). The Doppler effect formula becomes:

\[
\nu' = \nu \left( \frac{c}{c + v} \right)
\]

The beat frequency \( f_b \) is the difference between the emitted and received frequencies:

\[
f_b = |\nu - \nu'|
\]

When the car is approaching, the beat frequency is:

\[
f_b = \nu - \nu \left( \frac{c}{c - v} \right) = \nu \left( 1 - \frac{c}{c - v} \right)
\]

When the car is receding, the beat frequency is:

\[
f_b = \nu - \nu \left( \frac{c}{c + v} \right) = \nu \left( 1 - \frac{c}{c + v} \right)
\]

Thus, the beat frequency decreases when the car is receding compared to when it is approaching.

Microwaves of frequency \(\nu = \SI{800}{\mega\hertz}\) are beamed by a stationary policeman towards a receding car speeding at \(\SI{90}{\kilo\meter\per\hour}\). What beat frequency was registered by the radar?

\section*{Solution}

To find the beat frequency, we need to calculate the frequency shift due to the Doppler effect. The formula for the observed frequency \( \nu' \) when the source is stationary and the observer is moving away is given by:

\[
\nu' = \nu \left( 1 - \frac{v}{c} \right)
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\nu = \SI{800}{\mega\hertz}\) is the original frequency of the microwaves,
    \item \(v = \SI{90}{\kilo\meter\per\hour} = \frac{90 \times 1000}{3600} = \SI{25}{\meter\per\second}\) is the speed of the car,
    \item \(c = \SI{3e8}{\meter\per\second}\) is the speed of light.
\end{itemize}

Substituting the values into the equation:

\[
\nu' = \SI{800}{\mega\hertz} \left( 1 - \frac{\SI{25}{\meter\per\second}}{\SI{3e8}{\meter\per\second}} \right)
\]

\[
\nu' \approx \SI{800}{\mega\hertz} \left( 1 - 8.33 \times 10^{-8} \right)
\]

\[
\nu' \approx \SI{800}{\mega\hertz} - \SI{0.0667}{\hertz}
\]

The beat frequency \( f_b \) is the difference between the original frequency and the observed frequency:

\[
f_b = \nu - \nu' = \SI{0.0667}{\hertz}
\]

Thus, the beat frequency registered by the radar is approximately \(\SI{0.067}{\hertz}\).

\section*{Ampere's Law}

Ampere's Law states that the line integral of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ around a closed path is equal to the permeability of free space $\mu_0$ times the current $I_{\text{enc}}$ enclosed by the path:

\[
\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I_{\text{enc}}
\]

Consider a solid conductor of radius $a$ lying on the axis of a long cylindrical shell with inner radius $b$ and outer radius $c$. The central conductor carries a current $I$, while the outer conductor carries a current $-I$. The currents are uniformly distributed over the cross-sections of each conductor. We will use Ampere's law to calculate the magnetic field in each of the four regions by considering the current enclosed by a circular loop of radius $r$ centered on the axis of the inner conductor.

\subsection*{Regions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Region (a): $r < a$}

    In this region, the enclosed current $I_{\text{enc}}$ is proportional to the area of the loop relative to the total area of the conductor cross-section:
    \[
    I_{\text{enc}} = I \left(\frac{\pi r^2}{\pi a^2}\right) = I \left(\frac{r^2}{a^2}\right)
    \]
    Applying Ampere's law:
    \[
    \oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = B(2\pi r) = \mu_0 I \left(\frac{r^2}{a^2}\right)
    \]
    Solving for $B$:
    \[
    B = \frac{\mu_0 I r}{2\pi a^2}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Region (b): $a < r < b$}

    In this region, the entire current $I$ from the inner conductor is enclosed:
    \[
    I_{\text{enc}} = I
    \]
    Applying Ampere's law:
    \[
    \oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = B(2\pi r) = \mu_0 I
    \]
    Solving for $B$:
    \[
    B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Region (c): $b < r < c$}

    In this region, the enclosed current is the current from the inner conductor plus the part of the outer conductor's current that is enclosed:
    \[
    I_{\text{enc}} = I - I \left(\frac{\pi (r^2 - b^2)}{\pi (c^2 - b^2)}\right) = I \left(1 - \frac{r^2 - b^2}{c^2 - b^2}\right)
    \]
    Applying Ampere's law:
    \[
    \oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = B(2\pi r) = \mu_0 I \left(1 - \frac{r^2 - b^2}{c^2 - b^2}\right)
    \]
    Solving for $B$:
    \[
    B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r} \left(1 - \frac{r^2 - b^2}{c^2 - b^2}\right)
    \]

    \item \textbf{Region (d): $r > c$}

    In this region, the net enclosed current is zero because the currents in the inner and outer conductors cancel each other:
    \[
    I_{\text{enc}} = I - I = 0
    \]
    Applying Ampere's law:
    \[
    \oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = B(2\pi r) = \mu_0 \times 0 = 0
    \]
    Therefore, the magnetic field $B$ is zero:
    \[
    B = 0

14.58,"To estimate the energy stored in the magnetic field of the solenoid, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a magnetic field:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} B^2 V \mu_0
\]

where:
- \( B = 4 \, \text{T} \) is the magnetic field strength,
- \( V \) is the volume of the solenoid,
- \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T}\cdot\text{m/A} \) is the permeability of free space.

The volume \( V \) of the cylindrical solenoid is given by:

\[
V = \pi r^2 L
\]

where:
- \( r = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \, \text{m} \) is the radius of the solenoid,
- \( L = 12.5 \, \text{m} \) is the length of the solenoid.

\[
V = \pi (3 \, \text{m})^2 (12.5 \, \text{m}) = \pi \times 9 \times 12.5 \, \text{m}^3 = 112.5\pi \, \text{m}^3
\]

Now, substitute \( V \) and \( B \) into the energy formula:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} (4 \, \text{T})^2 (112.5\pi \, \text{m}^3) (4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T}\cdot\text{m/A})

\[
U = 2 \times 112.5 \times 4\pi^2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{J}

\[
U = 900\pi^2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{J}

\section*{Solution}

The total power $P$ radiated by the sun is given by:

\[
P = 4 \times 10^{26} \, \text{W}

The surface area $A$ of the sun can be calculated using the formula for the surface area of a sphere:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2

\[
A = 4 \pi (7 \times 10^{8})^2 \, \text{m}^2

The intensity $I$ of the electromagnetic radiation at the surface of the sun is given by:

\[

Substituting the expressions for $P$ and $A$, we have:

\[
I = \frac{4 \times 10^{26}}{4 \pi (7 \times 10^{8})^2} \, \text{W/m}^2

The intensity $I$ is also related to the electric field amplitude $E_0$ and magnetic field amplitude $B_0$ by the following relations:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 c E_0^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{B_0^2}{\mu_0}

14.60,"To estimate the amplitude of the electric field given the power of sunlight at the Earth's orbit, we can use the relationship between the intensity of an electromagnetic wave and the amplitude of its electric field.

- \( I \) is the intensity of the wave (power per unit area), given as 1300 \, \text{W/m}^2,
- \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space, approximately \( 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/\text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2 \),
- \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum, approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( E_0 \) is the amplitude of the electric field.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( E_0 \), we have:

\[
E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2I}{\epsilon_0 c}}

Substituting the given values:

\[
E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1300 \, \text{W/m}^2}{8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/\text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}}
\]

Calculating the above expression will give the amplitude of the electric field. Let's compute it:

\[
E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2600}{8.85 \times 3 \times 10^{-4}}}

\[
E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2600}{2.655 \times 10^{-3}}}

\[
E_0 = \sqrt{9.798 \times 10^5}

\]

We can solve for \(B\):
\[
B = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{300 \, \text{V/m}}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{T}
\]

Thus, the amplitude of the \(B\)-field is:
\[
B = 1 \, \mu\text{T}
\]

Next, we estimate the flux of radiation using the Poynting vector \(S\), which represents the power per unit area carried by the wave. The magnitude of the Poynting vector is given by:
\[
S = \frac{1}{\mu_0} E \times B
\]
where \(\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T}\cdot\text{m/A}\) is the permeability of free space.

Substituting the values:
\[
S = \frac{1}{4\pi \times 10^{-7}} \times 300 \times 1 \times 10^{-6}
\]

\[
S = \frac{300 \times 10^{-6}}{4\pi \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{300}{4\pi} \, \text{W/m}^2
\]

\[
S \approx 2.39 \times 10^2 \, \text{W/m}^2
\]

Therefore, the estimated flux of radiation at the surface of Mars is approximately:
\[
S \approx 239 \, \text{W/m}^2
\]

\section*{Problem}

Show that \( |E| \, |H| = 377 \, \Omega \, \phi \).

\section*{Solution}

To demonstrate this relationship, we start by considering the intrinsic impedance of free space, which is given by:

\[
\eta_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\varepsilon_0}} \approx 377 \, \Omega
\]

where \(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space and \(\varepsilon_0\) is the permittivity of free space.

In electromagnetic wave propagation, the magnitudes of the electric field \( |E| \) and the magnetic field \( |H| \) in free space are related by the intrinsic impedance:

\[
|E| = \eta_0 |H|
\]

Substituting \(\eta_0 \approx 377 \, \Omega\) into the equation, we have:

\[
|E| = 377 \, \Omega \, |H|
\]

Thus, multiplying both sides by \(|H|\), we obtain:

\[
|E| \, |H| = 377 \, \Omega \, |H|^2
\]

Assuming \(\phi\) is a constant or a parameter related to the problem context, we can express:

\[
|E| \, |H| = 377 \, \Omega \, \phi
\]

This completes the demonstration.

14.63,"To calculate the skin depth in copper for a given frequency, we use the formula for skin depth \( \delta \):

\[
\delta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega \mu \sigma}}
\]

where:
- \( \omega = 2\pi f \) is the angular frequency,
- \( \mu = \mu_0 \mu_r \) is the permeability of the material,
- \( \sigma \) is the conductivity of the material.

Given:
- Conductivity of copper, \( \sigma = 6 \times 10^7 \, \Omega^{-1}\text{m}^{-1} \),
- Frequency, \( f = 20 \, \text{kHz} = 20 \times 10^3 \, \text{Hz} \),
- Relative permeability of copper, \( \mu_r = 1 \).

First, calculate the angular frequency \( \omega \):

\[
\omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi \times 20 \times 10^3 \, \text{Hz}
\]

The permeability of free space \( \mu_0 \) is approximately \( 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m} \).

Thus, the permeability of copper \( \mu \) is:

\[
\mu = \mu_0 \mu_r = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 1 \, \text{H/m}
\]

Substitute these values into the skin depth formula:

\[
\delta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega \mu \sigma}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{(2\pi \times 20 \times 10^3) \times (4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \times (6 \times 10^7)}}

Simplify the expression:

\[
\delta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{2\pi \times 20 \times 10^3 \times 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 6 \times 10^7}}

\delta \approx \sqrt{\frac{2}{1.508 \times 10^9}} \approx \sqrt{1.326 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.64 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}

- The frequency \(f = 3000 \, \text{Mc/s} = 3000 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}\).

First, calculate the angular frequency \(\omega\):

\[
\omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi \times 3000 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}

Now, substitute these values into the skin depth formula:

\[
\delta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{(1 \times 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m})(5.6 \times 10^7 \, \Omega^{-1} \text{m}^{-1})(2\pi \times 3000 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz})}}

Simplifying the expression:

\[
\delta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{4\pi \times 5.6 \times 10^7 \times 2\pi \times 3000 \times 10^6}}

\[
\delta = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi^2 \times 5.6 \times 10^7 \times 3000 \times 10^6}}
\]

Finally, calculate the order of magnitude of \(\delta\):

\[
\delta \approx \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi^2 \times 1.68 \times 10^{17}}}
\]

\[
\delta \approx \sqrt{\frac{1}{2.11 \times 10^{18}}}

\[

\[

- \(\omega\) is the angular frequency,

14.66,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy transported by the light wave using the given maximum electric field. The energy transported by an electromagnetic wave can be determined using the Poynting vector, which relates the intensity of the wave to the electric field.

The intensity \( I \) of an electromagnetic wave is given by:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 c E_0^2
\]

- \( E_0 \) is the maximum electric field (\( E_0 = 10^{-3} \, \text{V/m} \)).

The energy transported per unit area per unit time (intensity) can be calculated as follows:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \times 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times (10^{-3} \, \text{V/m})^2

\section*{Poynting's Theorem}

Poynting's theorem is a fundamental statement in electromagnetism that relates the flow of electromagnetic energy to the work done on charges and the rate of energy storage in the fields. The theorem can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}) + \mathbf{E} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{H} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{j} = 0
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field,
    \item $\mathbf{H}$ is the magnetic field intensity,
    \item $\mathbf{D}$ is the electric displacement field,
    \item $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic flux density,
    \item $\mathbf{j}$ is the current density.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Interpretation}

The equation can be interpreted as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H})$ represents the divergence of the Poynting vector, which describes the flow of electromagnetic energy per unit area per unit time.
    \item $\mathbf{E} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t}$ and $\mathbf{H} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$ represent the rate of change of energy stored in the electric and magnetic fields, respectively.
    \item $\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{j}$ represents the work done on charges per unit volume, which is the power density supplied to the charges.
\end{itemize}

The theorem essentially states that the rate of energy leaving a given volume (through the surface) plus the rate of increase of energy stored in the fields within the volume is equal to the work done on the charges within that volume.

From Maxwell's equations, one can derive a wave equation for a dielectric of the form:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} - \mu_0 \sigma_N \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} = 0
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $t$ is the time, $\varepsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity, and $\sigma_N$ is the electrical conductivity.

To derive a dispersion relation, we substitute a traveling wave solution of the form:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)}
\end{equation}
into the wave equation. Here, $\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector and $\omega$ is the angular frequency.

Substituting this solution into the wave equation, we have:
\begin{align*}
    \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} & = -k^2 \mathbf{E}, \\
    \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} & = -\omega^2 \mathbf{E}, \\
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} & = -i\omega \mathbf{E}.
\end{align*}

Plugging these into the wave equation gives:

    -k^2 \mathbf{E} - \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r (-\omega^2 \mathbf{E}) - \mu_0 \sigma_N (-i\omega \mathbf{E}) = 0

Simplifying, we obtain the dispersion relation:
\begin{equation}
    k^2 = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r \omega^2 + i \mu_0 \sigma_N \omega

14.70,"To determine the power flow in a coaxial cable using the Poynting vector, we start by considering the electromagnetic fields in the cable. Assume a coaxial cable with an inner conductor of radius \( a \) and an outer conductor of radius \( b \). The cable carries a current \( I \) and a voltage \( V \) is applied across it.

The Poynting vector \(\mathbf{S}\) represents the power per unit area carried by an electromagnetic wave and is given by:

\[
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}
\]

where \(\mathbf{E}\) is the electric field and \(\mathbf{H}\) is the magnetic field. In a coaxial cable, the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) is radial, and the magnetic field \(\mathbf{H}\) is azimuthal.

### Electric Field

The electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) between the conductors can be found using Gauss's law. For a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius \( r \) (where \( a < r < b \)), the electric field is:

\[
E(r) = \frac{V}{r \ln(b/a)}
\]

### Magnetic Field

The magnetic field \(\mathbf{H}\) can be determined using Ampère's law. For a path of radius \( r \) (where \( a < r < b \)), the magnetic field is:

\[
H(r) = \frac{I}{2\pi r}
\]

### Poynting Vector

The Poynting vector \(\mathbf{S}\) is then:

\[
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H} = \left(\frac{V}{r \ln(b/a)}\right) \hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \left(\frac{I}{2\pi r}\right) \hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}
\]

The cross product \(\hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\) gives a direction along the length of the cable, \(\hat{\mathbf{z}}\). Thus, the magnitude of the Poynting vector is:

\[
S = \frac{VI}{2\pi r^2 \ln(b/a)}
\]

### Total Power Flow

To find the total power flow \( P \) through the cable, integrate the Poynting vector over the cylindrical surface between \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
P = \int_{a}^{b} S \cdot 2\pi r \, dr = \int_{a}^{b} \frac{VI}{2\pi r^2 \ln(b/a)} \cdot 2\pi r \, dr
\]

\[
P = \frac{VI}{\ln(b/a)} \int_{a}^{b} \frac{1}{r} \, dr = \frac{VI}{\ln(b/a)} \left[ \ln(r) \right]_{a}^{b}
\]

\[
P = \frac{VI}{\ln(b/a)} \left( \ln(b) - \ln(a) \right) = VI
\]

### Effect of Resistance

If the resistance of the conductors is not neglected, there will be power losses due to the resistive heating (Joule heating), which can be calculated using:

\[
P_{\text{loss}} = I^2 R
\]

where \( R \) is the resistance of the conductors. The actual power delivered to the load would then be reduced by this amount:

\[
P_{\text{delivered}} = VI - I^2 R
\]

In conclusion, neglecting the resistance of the conductors simplifies the analysis to show that the power flow is simply \( VI \), but in practical scenarios, the resistance causes additional power losses that must be accounted for."

\section*{Problem Statement}

A wire with radius $a$ and conductivity $\sigma_E$ carries a constant, uniformly distributed current $I$ in the $z$-direction. Apply Poynting's theorem to show that the power dissipated in the wire is given by the familiar expression $I^2 R$ for Joule's heat.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we start by recalling Poynting's theorem, which relates the rate of energy transfer per unit area (the Poynting vector $\mathbf{S}$) to the electromagnetic fields:

\[
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}
\]

where $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field and $\mathbf{H}$ is the magnetic field. The power dissipated in a volume $V$ is given by the integral of the divergence of the Poynting vector over that volume:

\[
P = \int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{S} \, dV
\]

For a wire carrying a current $I$, the power dissipated due to Joule heating can also be expressed as:

\[
P = I^2 R
\]

where $R$ is the resistance of the wire. We need to show that these two expressions for power are equivalent.

First, consider the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ inside the wire. Since the current density $\mathbf{J}$ is uniform, we have:

\[
\mathbf{J} = \sigma_E \mathbf{E}
\]

The current $I$ is related to the current density by:

\[
I = \int_A \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \sigma_E \int_A \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}
\]

where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the wire. For a cylindrical wire of radius $a$, the cross-sectional area is $A = \pi a^2$. Thus, the electric field can be expressed as:

\[
\mathbf{E} = \frac{I}{\sigma_E \pi a^2}
\]

Next, consider the magnetic field $\mathbf{H}$ around the wire. By Ampère's law, the magnetic field at a distance $r$ from the center of the wire is given by:

\[
H = \frac{I}{2\pi r}
\]

The Poynting vector $\mathbf{S}$ is then:

\[
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H} = \left(\frac{I}{\sigma_E \pi a^2}\right) \times \left(\frac{I}{2\pi r}\right) \hat{\mathbf{z}}
\]

The power dissipated in the wire is the integral of the Poynting vector over the surface of the wire:

\[
P = \int_0^a \int_0^{2\pi} \mathbf{S} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} \, r \, d\theta \, dr
\]

Substituting the expression for $\mathbf{S}$ and integrating, we find:

\[
P = \int_0^a \int_0^{2\pi} \left(\frac{I^2}{2\pi \sigma_E \pi a^2 r}\right) r \, d\theta \, dr = \frac{I^2}{\sigma_E \pi a^2} \cdot \pi a^2 = I^2 R
\]

where $R = \frac{1}{\sigma_E \pi a^2}$ is the resistance of the wire. Thus, we have shown that the power dissipated in the wire is indeed given by $I^2 R$, consistent with Joule's heat.

\section*{Problem}

An oscillating voltage of high frequency is applied to a load by means of a copper wire of radius \SI{1}{\milli\meter}. Given that the skin depth is \( \delta = 6.6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m} \) for this frequency, what is the high-frequency resistance per unit length of the wire in terms of its direct current resistance per unit length? [University of Durham 1966]

\section*{Solution}

The resistance per unit length of a wire at high frequency, \( R_{\text{hf}} \), is related to the direct current resistance per unit length, \( R_{\text{dc}} \), by the skin effect. The skin effect causes the current to be concentrated near the surface of the conductor, effectively reducing the cross-sectional area through which the current flows.

The direct current resistance per unit length is given by:
\[
R_{\text{dc}} = \frac{1}{\pi a^2 \sigma}
\]
where \( a = \SI{1}{\milli\meter} = \SI{1e-3}{\meter} \) is the radius of the wire and \( \sigma \) is the conductivity of copper.

At high frequencies, the effective cross-sectional area is reduced to the annular region of thickness equal to the skin depth \( \delta \). The high-frequency resistance per unit length is then:
\[
R_{\text{hf}} = \frac{1}{2\pi a \delta \sigma}
\]

The ratio of the high-frequency resistance to the direct current resistance is:
\[
\frac{R_{\text{hf}}}{R_{\text{dc}}} = \frac{\pi a^2 \sigma}{2\pi a \delta \sigma} = \frac{a}{2\delta}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
\frac{R_{\text{hf}}}{R_{\text{dc}}} = \frac{\SI{1e-3}{\meter}}{2 \times 6.6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}} = \frac{1}{2 \times 6.6 \times 10^{-2}} = \frac{1}{0.132} \approx 7.58
\]

Thus, the high-frequency resistance per unit length is approximately 7.58 times the direct current resistance per unit length.

14.74,"To derive the expression \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\) using Stokes' theorem, we start by recalling the integral form of Faraday's law of induction, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Stokes' theorem relates a surface integral over a surface \(S\) to a line integral around the boundary \(\partial S\) of that surface. The theorem is given by:

\[
\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = -\frac{d}{dt} \int_{S} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}
\]

where:
- \(\mathbf{E}\) is the electric field,
- \(d\mathbf{l}\) is the differential line element along the closed path \(\partial S\),
- \(\mathbf{B}\) is the magnetic field,
- \(d\mathbf{A}\) is the differential area vector of the surface \(S\).

Applying Stokes' theorem to the left-hand side of the equation, we have:

\[
\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \int_{S} (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) \cdot d\mathbf{A}
\]

Substituting this into Faraday's law, we get:

\[
\int_{S} (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) \cdot d\mathbf{A} = -\frac{d}{dt} \int_{S} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}
\]

Assuming that the surface \(S\) is fixed in space, the time derivative can be taken inside the integral:

\[
\int_{S} (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_{S} \left(-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\right) \cdot d\mathbf{A}
\]

Since this equation holds for any arbitrary surface \(S\), we equate the integrands:

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}

\title{Vectors \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\) in Magnetism}
\author{University of Durham 1962}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Introduction}

In the theory of magnetism, the vectors \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\) represent different physical quantities. \(\mathbf{B}\), the magnetic flux density (or magnetic induction), describes the magnetic field's effect in a medium, while \(\mathbf{H}\), the magnetic field strength, represents the magnetic field's intensity in free space. The relationship between these vectors is crucial for understanding magnetic materials.

\section*{Derivation of \(\mathbf{B} = \mu_0(\mathbf{H} + \mathbf{M})\)}

The magnetic flux density \(\mathbf{B}\) is related to the magnetic field strength \(\mathbf{H}\) and the magnetization \(\mathbf{M}\) of the material by the equation:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 (\mathbf{H} + \mathbf{M})
\end{equation}

where \(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space. This equation indicates that the magnetic flux density \(\mathbf{B}\) is the sum of the applied magnetic field \(\mathbf{H}\) and the magnetization \(\mathbf{M}\), scaled by the permeability of free space.

\section*{Dependence of \(\mathbf{B}\) on Material Type}

The dependence of \(\mathbf{B}\) on the material type can be briefly described as follows:

\subsection*{(a) Paramagnetics}

In paramagnetic materials, the magnetization \(\mathbf{M}\) is directly proportional to the applied magnetic field \(\mathbf{H}\), but the proportionality constant is small. Therefore, the equation becomes:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \left( \mathbf{H} + \chi_m \mathbf{H} \right) = \mu_0 (1 + \chi_m) \mathbf{H}
\end{equation}

where \(\chi_m\) is the magnetic susceptibility of the paramagnetic material. Since \(\chi_m\) is positive but small, \(\mathbf{B}\) is slightly greater than \(\mu_0 \mathbf{H}\).

\subsection*{(b) Ferromagnetics}

In ferromagnetic materials, the magnetization \(\mathbf{M}\) is much larger and can be non-linear with respect to \(\mathbf{H}\). The relationship is complex and often involves hysteresis. However, the general form remains:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 (\mathbf{H} + \mathbf{M})
\end{equation}

In this case, \(\mathbf{B}\) can be significantly larger than \(\mu_0 \mathbf{H}\) due to the large \(\mathbf{M}\).

\section*{Physics Problems and Solutions}

\subsection*{(a) Electromagnetic Wave Propagation and Polarization}

The electric field of an electromagnetic wave propagating in free space is described by the equation:
\[
\vec{E}(z,t) = E_0 \left[ \hat{x} \sin(kz - \omega t) + \hat{y} \cos(kz - \omega t) \right]
\]
where \(\hat{x}\) and \(\hat{y}\) are unit vectors in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions, respectively.

\textbf{Direction of Propagation:}  
The wave is propagating in the \(z\)-direction. This can be inferred from the argument of the sine and cosine functions, \(kz - \omega t\), which indicates variation along the \(z\)-axis.

\textbf{Polarization of the Wave:}  
The wave is elliptically polarized. This is because the electric field components in the \(\hat{x}\) and \(\hat{y}\) directions are out of phase by \(\pi/2\) radians, leading to an elliptical trajectory for the tip of the electric field vector.

\subsection*{(b) Boundary Conditions for Magnetic Fields}

\textbf{Boundary Conditions:}  
At the boundary between two media with different magnetic properties, the following boundary conditions are satisfied:

1. The tangential components of the magnetic field intensity \(\vec{H}\) are continuous:
   \[
   \vec{H}_{1t} = \vec{H}_{2t}
   \]
2. The normal components of the magnetic flux density \(\vec{B}\) are continuous if there are no surface currents:
   \[
   \vec{B}_{1n} = \vec{B}_{2n}
   \]

\textbf{Proof:}

Consider a boundary separating two media with permeability \(\mu_1\) and \(\mu_2\). Using Ampère's Law and Gauss's Law for magnetism, we derive these conditions:

- For the tangential component, applying Ampère's Law in integral form around a loop straddling the boundary gives:
  \[
  \oint \vec{H} \cdot d\vec{l} = I_{\text{free}} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \vec{H}_{1t} = \vec{H}_{2t}
  \]

- For the normal component, using Gauss's Law for magnetism:
  \[
  \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \vec{B}_{1n} = \vec{B}_{2n}
  \]

\subsection*{(c) Snell's Law for Magnetic Permeability}

Show that:
\[
\tan \theta_1 \tan \theta_2 = \frac{\mu_1}{\mu_2}
\]

\textbf{Derivation:}

Consider the boundary conditions and Snell's Law for refraction at the interface between two media. From the continuity of the tangential component of \(\vec{H}\) and the relationship between \(\vec{B}\) and \(\vec{H}\) (\(\vec{B} = \mu \vec{H}\)), we have:
\[
\frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1}
\]

Using the identity \(\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}\), we can express:
\[
\tan \theta_1 = \frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta_1}}, \quad \tan \theta_2 = \frac{\sin \theta_2}{\sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta_2}}
\]

Substituting the relationship from Snell's Law:
\[
\tan \theta_1 \tan \theta_2 = \frac{\sin \theta_1 \sin \theta_2}{\sqrt{(1 - \sin^2 \theta_1)(1 - \sin^2 \theta_2)}} = \frac{\mu_1}{\mu_2}
\]

Thus, the relationship is proven.

\section*{Problem Statement}

An electromagnetic wave is normally incident on a dielectric discontinuity. Use appropriate boundary conditions to calculate the reflectance $R$ and the transmittance $T$, and show that $T + R = 1$.

\section*{Solution}

When a plane wave is normally incident on a boundary between two dielectric media, the boundary conditions at the interface require the continuity of the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields. For normal incidence, these conditions reduce to the continuity of the electric field $E$ and the magnetic field $H$ across the boundary.

Let the incident wave be described by the electric field $E_i = E_0 e^{i(k_1 z - \omega t)}$, where $k_1$ is the wave number in the first medium. The reflected wave is $E_r = R E_0 e^{i(-k_1 z - \omega t)}$, and the transmitted wave is $E_t = T E_0 e^{i(k_2 z - \omega t)}$, where $k_2$ is the wave number in the second medium.

The boundary conditions at $z = 0$ are:
\begin{align}
    E_i + E_r &= E_t, \\
    \frac{1}{\mu_1} (E_i - E_r) &= \frac{1}{\mu_2} E_t,
\end{align}
where $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are the permeabilities of the first and second media, respectively.

Solving these equations for $R$ and $T$, we find:
\begin{align}
    R &= \frac{\mu_2 k_1 - \mu_1 k_2}{\mu_2 k_1 + \mu_1 k_2}, \\
    T &= \frac{2 \mu_2 k_1}{\mu_2 k_1 + \mu_1 k_2}.
\end{align}

To show that $T + R = 1$, we compute:
\begin{align*}
    T + R &= \frac{2 \mu_2 k_1}{\mu_2 k_1 + \mu_1 k_2} + \frac{\mu_2 k_1 - \mu_1 k_2}{\mu_2 k_1 + \mu_1 k_2} \\
    &= \frac{2 \mu_2 k_1 + \mu_2 k_1 - \mu_1 k_2}{\mu_2 k_1 + \mu_1 k_2} \\
    &= \frac{(\mu_2 k_1 + \mu_1 k_2) + (\mu_2 k_1 - \mu_1 k_2)}{\mu_2 k_1 + \mu_1 k_2} \\
    &= \frac{2 \mu_2 k_1}{\mu_2 k_1 + \mu_1 k_2} \\
    &= 1.
\end{align*}

Thus, $T + R = 1$, as required.

An electromagnetic wave, propagating and linearly polarized in the $xz$-plane, is incident onto an interface between two non-conducting media as shown in Fig. 14.10. The electric fields and propagation vectors of the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves are denoted by $\mathbf{E}_I$, $\mathbf{E}_R$, $\mathbf{E}_T$, $\mathbf{k}_I$, $\mathbf{k}_R$, and $\mathbf{k}_T$ respectively.

(a) Using the expressions for $R$ in prob. (14.80) and Snell's law, show that the reflectance is zero when $\tan \theta = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$.

(b) Calculate this angle for electromagnetic radiation in air incident onto glass, which has a refractive index $n = 1.5$.

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Show that the reflectance is zero when $\tan \theta = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$}

From Snell's law, we have:
\begin{equation}
n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2
\end{equation}

The reflectance $R$ is given by the Fresnel equations. For the case of zero reflectance, we consider the Brewster angle condition, where the reflected light is completely polarized. This occurs when:
\begin{equation}
\tan \theta_B = \frac{n_2}{n_1}
\end{equation}

At the Brewster angle $\theta_B$, the reflectance $R$ is zero for the p-polarized light (parallel polarization). Therefore, the condition $\tan \theta = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$ ensures that the reflectance is zero.

\subsection*{(b) Calculate this angle for electromagnetic radiation in air incident onto glass}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Refractive index of air, $n_1 = 1.0$
    \item Refractive index of glass, $n_2 = 1.5$
\end{itemize}

Using the Brewster angle formula:
\begin{equation}
\tan \theta_B = \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{1.5}{1.0} = 1.5
\end{equation}

To find the Brewster angle $\theta_B$, we take the arctangent:
\begin{equation}
\theta_B = \tan^{-1}(1.5)
\end{equation}

Calculating the angle:
\begin{equation}
\theta_B \approx 56.31^\circ
\end{equation}

Thus, the angle at which the reflectance is zero for electromagnetic radiation in air incident onto glass is approximately $56.31^\circ$.

\section*{Problem}

(a) For normal incidence, the reflection coefficient, \( R \), at the planar surface between two dielectric media is given by 
\[
R = \left( \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \right)^2
\]
where \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the refractive indices of the media. Sketch the form of \( R \) against \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \). On the same figure, sketch the form of \( T \) against \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) where \( T \) is the transmission coefficient. Indicate numerical values of \( T \) and \( R \) where appropriate.

(b) At what value of \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) does \( R = T \)?

\section*{Solution}

The reflection coefficient \( R \) is given by:
\[
R = \left( \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \right)^2
\]

The transmission coefficient \( T \) is related to \( R \) by:
\[
T = 1 - R
\]

To find the value of \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) where \( R = T \), we set:
\[
R = T \implies \left( \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \right)^2 = 1 - \left( \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \right)^2
\]

Solving the equation:
\[
2 \left( \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \right)^2 = 1
\]

\[
\left( \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Solving for \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \), we find:
\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{1 \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{1 \mp \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}
\]

For the sketch, consider the range of \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) from 0 to 2. The plot of \( R \) and \( T \) against \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) will show \( R \) starting from 1 at \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} = 0 \) and decreasing to 0 as \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) approaches 1, while \( T \) starts at 0 and increases to 1.

    \item[(c)] Show that the magnitudes of $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{E}$ are related by $\mathbf{B} = \frac{\mathbf{E}}{c}$ for free space in the SI system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] To show that $\mathbf{B}$ is perpendicular to $\mathbf{E}$, we use Maxwell's equations in free space. Specifically, the curl of the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is related to the time derivative of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$:
    \[
    \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}.
    \]
    For a plane wave, this implies that $\mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{E}_0 = \omega \mathbf{B}_0$. Since $\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector, it is perpendicular to both $\mathbf{E}_0$ and $\mathbf{B}_0$. Therefore, $\mathbf{E}_0 \cdot \mathbf{B}_0 = 0$, showing that $\mathbf{B}$ is perpendicular to $\mathbf{E}$.

    \item[(b)] To show that $\mathbf{B}$ is in phase with $\mathbf{E}$, observe that both fields have the same exponential factor $e^{i(\omega t - \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} + \varphi)}$. This indicates that $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{E}$ oscillate with the same frequency and phase, confirming that they are in phase.

    \item[(c)] To show that $\mathbf{B} = \frac{\mathbf{E}}{c}$, we use the relationship from Maxwell's equations:
    \[
    \mathbf{B}_0 = \frac{\mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{E}_0}{\omega}.
    \]
    In free space, the speed of light $c$ is given by $c = \frac{\omega}{k}$. Therefore, we have
    \[
    \mathbf{B}_0 = \frac{k}{\omega} \mathbf{E}_0 = \frac{\mathbf{E}_0}{c}.

\section*{Problem}

An uncharged dielectric cube of material with relative permittivity $\varepsilon_r = 6$ contains a uniform electric field $\mathbf{E}$ of \SI{2}{\kilo\volt\per\meter}, which is perpendicular to one of the faces. What is the surface charge density induced on this face? [University of Manchester 2006]

\section*{Solution}

The surface charge density $\sigma$ induced on the face of the dielectric can be determined using the relation between the electric displacement field $\mathbf{D}$ and the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ in a dielectric material:

\[
\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r \mathbf{E}
\]

where $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, approximately \SI{8.85e-12}{\farad\per\meter}.

The surface charge density $\sigma$ is given by the normal component of the electric displacement field:

\[
\sigma = \mathbf{D} \cdot \hat{n}
\]

Since the electric field is perpendicular to the face, the normal component is simply:

\[
\sigma = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r E
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\sigma = (\SI{8.85e-12}{\farad\per\meter}) \times 6 \times \SI{2e3}{\volt\per\meter}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\sigma = \SI{1.062e-7}{\coulomb\per\meter\squared}
\]

Thus, the surface charge density induced on the face is approximately \SI{1.062e-7}{\coulomb\per\meter\squared}.

\title{Physics Problem: Phase and Group Velocity in Air}
\author{University of Manchester 1972}

\maketitle

\section*{Problem}

Using the results of problem (14.93) and the following table, estimate the fractional difference between the phase and group velocity in air at a wavelength of \SI{5000}{\angstrom}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c c}

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Refractive index data for air.}
\end{table}

\section*{Solution}

The phase velocity $v_p$ is given by:
\[
v_p = \frac{c}{n}
\]
where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $n$ is the refractive index.

The group velocity $v_g$ is given by:
\[
v_g = c \left( \frac{d(k n)}{dk} \right)^{-1}
\]
where $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number.

The fractional difference between the phase and group velocity is:
\[
\frac{v_p - v_g}{v_p} = 1 - \frac{v_g}{v_p}
\]

Using the given data for \SI{5000}{\angstrom}, we have $n - 1 = 2.781 \times 10^{-4}$, so $n = 1 + 2.781 \times 10^{-4}$.

To find $\frac{v_g}{v_p}$, we need to calculate:
\[
\frac{d(n \lambda)}{d\lambda} = n + \lambda \frac{dn}{d\lambda}
\]

Using the data from the table, estimate $\frac{dn}{d\lambda}$ by finite differences:
\[
\frac{dn}{d\lambda} \approx \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-4} - 2.781 \times 10^{-4}}{5200 - 5000} = -2 \times 10^{-7} \, \si{\angstrom^{-1}}
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{d(n \lambda)}{d\lambda} \approx 1.0002781 + 5000 \times (-2 \times 10^{-7}) = 1.0001781
\]

Therefore:
\[
\frac{v_g}{v_p} = \frac{1}{1.0001781}
\]

Finally, the fractional difference is:
\[
\frac{v_p - v_g}{v_p} = 1 - \frac{1}{1.0001781} \approx 1.78 \times 10^{-4}
\]

Thus, the fractional difference between the phase and group velocity in air at \SI{5000}{\angstrom} is approximately $1.78 \times 10^{-4}$.

\section*{Problem}

Given the dispersion relation \(\omega = a k^2\), calculate:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The phase velocity.
    \item The group velocity.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Phase Velocity}

The phase velocity \(v_p\) is defined as the ratio of the angular frequency \(\omega\) to the wave number \(k\):
\[
v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}
\]
Substituting the given dispersion relation \(\omega = a k^2\) into the equation for phase velocity, we get:
\[
v_p = \frac{a k^2}{k} = a k
\]

\subsection*{(b) Group Velocity}

The group velocity \(v_g\) is defined as the derivative of the angular frequency \(\omega\) with respect to the wave number \(k\):
\[
v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}
\]
Differentiating the given dispersion relation \(\omega = a k^2\) with respect to \(k\), we find:
\[
v_g = \frac{d}{dk}(a k^2) = 2a k
\]

Thus, the phase velocity is \(v_p = a k\) and the group velocity is \(v_g = 2a k\).

\section*{Physics Problem and Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Phase Velocity of an Electromagnetic Wave}

The phase velocity \( v_p \) of an electromagnetic wave in a medium with permittivity \( \varepsilon \) and permeability \( \mu \) is given by:

\[
v_p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon \mu}}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Refractive Index and Dispersion Relation}

The relative permittivity \( \varepsilon_r \) in an ionized gas is given by:

\[
\varepsilon_r = 1 - \frac{D^2}{\omega^2}
\]

where \( D \) is a constant and \( \omega \) is the angular frequency. The refractive index \( n \) is related to the relative permittivity by:

\[
n = \sqrt{\varepsilon_r} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{D^2}{\omega^2}}
\]

To find the dispersion relation, we start with the relation for the refractive index:

\[
n^2 = \varepsilon_r = 1 - \frac{D^2}{\omega^2}
\]

The wave equation in a medium gives:

\[
n^2 = \left(\frac{c k}{\omega}\right)^2
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( n^2 \):

\[
\left(\frac{c k}{\omega}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{D^2}{\omega^2}
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
\omega^2 = D^2 + c^2 k^2
\]

\subsection*{(c) Phase and Group Velocity Relationship}

The group velocity \( v_g \) is given by:

\[
v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}
\]

From the dispersion relation \( \omega^2 = D^2 + c^2 k^2 \), differentiate with respect to \( k \):

\[
2\omega \frac{d\omega}{dk} = 2c^2 k
\]

Thus,

\[
v_g = \frac{c^2 k}{\omega}
\]

The product of phase and group velocities is:

\[
v_p v_g = \frac{\omega}{k} \cdot \frac{c^2 k}{\omega} = c^2
\]

\subsection*{(d) Phase and Group Velocities at 20 GHz}

Given \( D = 1.2 \times 10^{11} \, \text{s}^{-1} \) and \( f = 20 \, \text{GHz} \), find \( \omega \) and \( k \):

\[
\omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi \times 20 \times 10^9 \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

Using the dispersion relation \( \omega^2 = D^2 + c^2 k^2 \), solve for \( k \):

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{\omega^2 - D^2}}{c}
\]

Calculate \( v_p \) and \( v_g \):

\[
v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}
\]

\[
v_g = \frac{c^2 k}{\omega}
\]

Both calculations should confirm that \( v_p v_g = c^2 \). Comment: The result shows that the product of phase and group velocities in this medium equals the square of the speed of light in vacuum, consistent with the theoretical prediction.

14.90,"To show that if the phase velocity varies inversely with the wavelength, then the group velocity is twice the phase velocity, we start by defining the relevant terms and equations.

The phase velocity \( v_p \) is given by:

\[
v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}
\]

where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency and \( k \) is the wave number. If the phase velocity varies inversely with the wavelength \( \lambda \), we have:

\[
v_p = \frac{C}{\lambda}
\]

where \( C \) is a constant. Since the wave number \( k \) is related to the wavelength by \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \), we can express the phase velocity as:

\[
v_p = \frac{C \cdot k}{2\pi}
\]

Now, the group velocity \( v_g \) is defined as:

\[
v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}
\]

Given that \( \omega = v_p \cdot k \), we substitute for \( v_p \):

\[
\omega = \frac{C \cdot k^2}{2\pi}
\]

Taking the derivative of \( \omega \) with respect to \( k \):

\[
\frac{d\omega}{dk} = \frac{d}{dk} \left( \frac{C \cdot k^2}{2\pi} \right) = \frac{C \cdot 2k}{2\pi} = \frac{C \cdot k}{\pi}
\]

Thus, the group velocity \( v_g \) is:

\[
v_g = \frac{C \cdot k}{\pi}
\]

Comparing \( v_g \) and \( v_p \):

\[
v_p = \frac{C \cdot k}{2\pi}
\]

\[
v_g = \frac{C \cdot k}{\pi} = 2 \times \frac{C \cdot k}{2\pi} = 2v_p

\section*{Problem Statement}

For a rectangular waveguide of width \SI{2.5}{\centi\meter}, determine the free-space wavelength of radiation required for energy to traverse \SI{50}{\meter} of the guide in \SI{1}{\micro\second}. Additionally, calculate the phase velocity under these conditions.

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Given Data}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Width of the waveguide, \( a = \SI{2.5}{\centi\meter} = \SI{0.025}{\meter} \)
    \item Length of the waveguide, \( L = \SI{50}{\meter} \)
    \item Time for energy to traverse the guide, \( t = \SI{1}{\micro\second} = \SI{1e-6}{\second} \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Calculation of Free-Space Wavelength}

The speed of light in free space is \( c = \SI{3e8}{\meter\per\second} \).

The group velocity \( v_g \) in the waveguide is given by:
\[
v_g = \frac{L}{t} = \frac{\SI{50}{\meter}}{\SI{1e-6}{\second}} = \SI{5e7}{\meter\per\second}
\]

The cutoff wavelength \( \lambda_c \) for the \(\text{TE}_{10}\) mode in a rectangular waveguide is:
\[
\lambda_c = 2a = 2 \times \SI{0.025}{\meter} = \SI{0.05}{\meter}
\]

The free-space wavelength \( \lambda_0 \) is related to the group velocity and cutoff wavelength by:
\[
v_g = c \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda_c}\right)^2}
\]

Solving for \( \lambda_0 \):
\[
\left(\frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda_c}\right)^2 = 1 - \left(\frac{v_g}{c}\right)^2
\]
\[
\lambda_0 = \lambda_c \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v_g}{c}\right)^2}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
\lambda_0 = \SI{0.05}{\meter} \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\SI{5e7}{\meter\per\second}}{\SI{3e8}{\meter\per\second}}\right)^2}
\]

\subsection*{Calculation of Phase Velocity}

The phase velocity \( v_p \) in the waveguide is given by:
\[
v_p = \frac{c}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda_c}\right)^2}}
\]

Substitute the expression for \( \lambda_0 \):

v_p = \frac{c}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v_g}{c}\right)^2}}

14.93,"To show the relationship between the group velocity \( v_g \) and the phase velocity \( v_p \) for light waves in a medium, we start with the given expression:

\[

\]

where:
- \( \omega \) is the angular frequency of the light waves,
- \( n \) is the refractive index of the medium,
- \( c \) is the speed of light in free space.

**Derivation:**

1. **Phase Velocity:**
   The phase velocity \( v_p \) is given by:
   \[
   v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}
   \]
   where \( k \) is the wave number, \( k = \frac{n\omega}{c} \).

2. **Group Velocity:**
   The group velocity \( v_g \) is defined as:
   \[
   v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}
   \]

3. **Differentiating \( k \):**
   Since \( k = \frac{n\omega}{c} \), differentiate with respect to \( \omega \):
   \[
   \frac{dk}{d\omega} = \frac{1}{c} \left( n + \omega \frac{dn}{d\omega} \right)
   \]

4. **Expression for \( v_g \):**
   Using the definition of group velocity:
   \[
   v_g = \frac{1}{\frac{dk}{d\omega}} = \frac{c}{n + \omega \frac{dn}{d\omega}}
   \]

5. **Relating \( v_g \) and \( v_p \):**
   Substitute \( v_p = \frac{c}{n} \) into the expression for \( v_g \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{v_g} = \frac{n + \omega \frac{dn}{d\omega}}{c} = \frac{n}{c} + \frac{\omega}{c} \frac{dn}{d\omega}
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{1}{v_g} = \frac{1}{v_p} + \frac{\omega}{c} \frac{dn}{d\omega}

14.94,"To prove the given expression for the group velocity of a light wave in a medium, we start with the definition of group velocity \( v_g \) and manipulate it to show the desired form. Here is the LaTeX code for the proof:

\section*{Proof of Group Velocity Expression}

The group velocity \( v_g \) of a wave is defined as the derivative of the angular frequency \( \omega \) with respect to the wave number \( k \):

\[
v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}
\]

For a light wave in a medium, the angular frequency \( \omega \) is related to the frequency \( v \) by \( \omega = 2\pi v \), and the wave number \( k \) is related to the wavelength \( \lambda \) by \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \). The phase velocity \( c \) in free space is given by:

\[
c = \frac{\omega}{k}
\]

In a medium, the phase velocity \( v_p \) is given by:

\[
v_p = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{c}{n}
\]

where \( n \) is the refractive index of the medium. Thus, the relationship between the phase velocity in the medium and the refractive index is:

\[
v_p = \frac{c}{n}
\]

To find the group velocity \( v_g \), we differentiate \( \omega = kv_p \) with respect to \( k \):

\[
v_g = \frac{d}{dk}(kv_p) = v_p + k\frac{dv_p}{dk}
\]

Since \( v_p = \frac{c}{n} \), we have:

\[
\frac{dv_p}{dk} = \frac{d}{dk}\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) = -\frac{c}{n^2}\frac{dn}{dk}
\]

Substituting back, we get:

\[
v_g = \frac{c}{n} - k\frac{c}{n^2}\frac{dn}{dk}
\]

Rewriting the expression in terms of frequency \( v \) and using the relation \( k = \frac{2\pi n v}{c} \), we have:

\[
v_g = \frac{c}{n} - \frac{2\pi n v}{c} \cdot \frac{c}{n^2} \cdot \frac{dn}{d(2\pi n v/c)}
\]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[
v_g = \frac{c}{n} - v \frac{d(nv)}{dv}
\]

Thus, the group velocity \( v_g \) can be rearranged as:

\[
v_g = c \frac{d}{dv}(nv)
\]

This completes the proof.

```

This LaTeX document provides a structured proof showing how the group velocity \( v_g \) can be expressed in terms of the phase velocity \( c \), frequency \( v \), and refractive index \( n \)."
14.95,"To show that the group velocity associated with a free non-relativistic particle is the classical velocity of the particle, we start by considering the wave packet description of a particle. The group velocity \( v_g \) is given by the derivative of the angular frequency \( \omega \) with respect to the wave number \( k \):

\[
v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}
\]

For a free particle, the energy \( E \) is related to the angular frequency by the Planck-Einstein relation:

\[
E = \hbar \omega
\]

and the momentum \( p \) is related to the wave number by the de Broglie relation:

\[
p = \hbar k
\]

For a non-relativistic particle, the energy is given by the classical kinetic energy expression:

\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m}
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( E \) and \( p \) in terms of \( \omega \) and \( k \), we have:

\[
\hbar \omega = \frac{(\hbar k)^2}{2m}
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
\omega = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m}
\]

Now, we compute the group velocity \( v_g \):

\[
v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk} = \frac{d}{dk} \left( \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2m} \cdot 2k = \frac{\hbar k}{m}
\]

Since \( p = \hbar k \), we have:

\[
v_g = \frac{p}{m}
\]

This is precisely the classical velocity \( v \) of the particle, confirming that the group velocity is indeed the classical velocity:

\[
v_g = v = \frac{p}{m}
\]

Thus, we have shown that the group velocity associated with a free non-relativistic particle is the classical velocity of the particle."
14.96,"To calculate the group velocity of light in glass, we need to use the formula for group velocity \( v_g \), which is given by:

\[
v_g = c \left( n - \lambda \frac{dn}{d\lambda} \right)^{-1}
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum, \( n \) is the refractive index, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.

Given the refractive index \( \mu \) as a function of wavelength \( \lambda \):

\[
\mu = 1.420 + 3.60 \times 10^{-14} \lambda^2
\]

we need to find \( \frac{d\mu}{d\lambda} \).

First, differentiate \( \mu \) with respect to \( \lambda \):

\[
\frac{d\mu}{d\lambda} = \frac{d}{d\lambda} \left( 1.420 + 3.60 \times 10^{-14} \lambda^2 \right) = 2 \times 3.60 \times 10^{-14} \lambda = 7.20 \times 10^{-14} \lambda
\]

Now, substitute \( \lambda = 500 \) nm \( = 500 \times 10^{-9} \) m into the expressions for \( \mu \) and \( \frac{d\mu}{d\lambda} \):

\[
\mu = 1.420 + 3.60 \times 10^{-14} (500 \times 10^{-9})^2
\]

\[
= 1.420 + 3.60 \times 10^{-14} \times 2.5 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
= 1.420 + 9.00 \times 10^{-27}
\]

Since \( 9.00 \times 10^{-27} \) is negligible, we have \( \mu \approx 1.420 \).

Next, calculate \( \frac{d\mu}{d\lambda} \) at \( \lambda = 500 \times 10^{-9} \) m:

\[
\frac{d\mu}{d\lambda} = 7.20 \times 10^{-14} \times 500 \times 10^{-9} = 3.60 \times 10^{-20}
\]

Now, substitute these values into the group velocity formula:

\[
v_g = c \left( \mu - \lambda \frac{d\mu}{d\lambda} \right)^{-1}
\]

\[
= c \left( 1.420 - 500 \times 10^{-9} \times 3.60 \times 10^{-20} \right)^{-1}
\]

\[
= c \left( 1.420 - 1.80 \times 10^{-28} \right)^{-1}
\]

Since \( 1.80 \times 10^{-28} \) is negligible, we have:

\[
v_g \approx \frac{c}{1.420}
\]

Thus, the group velocity of light of wavelength 500 nm in glass is approximately:

\[
v_g \approx \frac{c}{1.420}
\]

where \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Therefore, the group velocity is:

\[
v_g \approx \frac{3 \times 10^8}{1.420} \, \text{m/s}
\]

This completes the calculation of the group velocity."

\section*{Problem}

A rectangular waveguide has a width $a = 3 \, \text{cm}$. What should be the free-space wavelength if the guide wavelength is to be thrice the free-space wavelength?

\section*{Solution}

Let $\lambda_0$ be the free-space wavelength and $\lambda_g$ be the guide wavelength. According to the problem, we have:

\[
\lambda_g = 3 \lambda_0
\]

The relationship between the guide wavelength $\lambda_g$, the free-space wavelength $\lambda_0$, and the cutoff wavelength $\lambda_c$ for a rectangular waveguide is given by:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda_g^2} = \frac{1}{\lambda_0^2} - \frac{1}{\lambda_c^2}
\]

For a rectangular waveguide with width $a$, the cutoff wavelength $\lambda_c$ for the dominant mode (TE$_{10}$) is:

\[
\lambda_c = 2a
\]

Substituting $\lambda_c = 2a$ into the equation, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{(3\lambda_0)^2} = \frac{1}{\lambda_0^2} - \frac{1}{(2a)^2}
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{9\lambda_0^2} = \frac{1}{\lambda_0^2} - \frac{1}{4a^2}
\]

Rearranging terms gives:

\[
\frac{1}{4a^2} = \frac{1}{\lambda_0^2} - \frac{1}{9\lambda_0^2}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{4a^2} = \frac{8}{9\lambda_0^2}
\]

Solving for $\lambda_0$, we find:

\[
\lambda_0^2 = \frac{8}{9} \times 4a^2
\]

\[
\lambda_0 = \frac{2a}{3}
\]

Substituting $a = 3 \, \text{cm}$:

\[
\lambda_0 = \frac{2 \times 3 \, \text{cm}}{3} = 2 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the free-space wavelength should be $2 \, \text{cm}$.

\section*{Problem}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Calculate the guide wavelength for a rectangular waveguide of width \( a = 5 \, \text{cm} \) if the free-space wavelength is \( \lambda_0 = 8 \, \text{cm} \).
    \item[(b)] What is the cut-off wavelength for the guide?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Guide Wavelength}

The guide wavelength \( \lambda_g \) in a rectangular waveguide is given by the formula:

\[
\lambda_g = \frac{\lambda_0}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\lambda_0}{2a}\right)^2}}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \lambda_0 = 8 \, \text{cm} \) is the free-space wavelength,
    \item \( a = 5 \, \text{cm} \) is the width of the waveguide.
\end{itemize}

Substituting the given values:

\[
\lambda_g = \frac{8}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{8}{2 \times 5}\right)^2}} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{8}{10}\right)^2}} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{1 - 0.64}}
\]

\[
\lambda_g = \frac{8}{\sqrt{0.36}} = \frac{8}{0.6} = 13.33 \, \text{cm}
\]

\subsection*{(b) Cut-off Wavelength}

The cut-off wavelength \( \lambda_c \) for the dominant mode in a rectangular waveguide is given by:

\[
\lambda_c = 2a
\]

Substituting the given width:

\[
\lambda_c = 2 \times 5 = 10 \, \text{cm}

14.100,"To calculate the number of states of electromagnetic radiation between 5000 Å and 6000 Å in wavelength using periodic boundary conditions in a cubical region of side 0.5 cm, we can use the following approach:

1. **Determine the volume of the cube**: 
   \[
   V = (0.5 \, \text{cm})^3 = 0.125 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

2. **Convert the wavelength range to meters**:
   \[
   \lambda_1 = 5000 \, \text{Å} = 5000 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}
   \]
   \[
   \lambda_2 = 6000 \, \text{Å} = 6000 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}
   \]

3. **Calculate the corresponding frequency range using \( c = \lambda \nu \)**:
   \[
   \nu_1 = \frac{c}{\lambda_2} = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{6000 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}}
   \]
   \[
   \nu_2 = \frac{c}{\lambda_1} = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{5000 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of states**:
   The number of states \( g(\nu) \) in a frequency interval \( d\nu \) is given by:
   \[
   g(\nu) \, d\nu = \frac{8\pi V \nu^2}{c^3} \, d\nu
   \]

5. **Integrate over the frequency range**:
   \[
   N = \int_{\nu_1}^{\nu_2} \frac{8\pi V \nu^2}{c^3} \, d\nu
   \]

6. **Substitute the values and compute**:
   \[
   N = \frac{8\pi \times 0.125 \, \text{cm}^3}{(3 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s})^3} \int_{\nu_1}^{\nu_2} \nu^2 \, d\nu
   \]

   Solving the integral:
   \[
   \int_{\nu_1}^{\nu_2} \nu^2 \, d\nu = \left[ \frac{\nu^3}{3} \right]_{\nu_1}^{\nu_2} = \frac{\nu_2^3 - \nu_1^3}{3}
   \]

   Substituting back:
   \[
   N = \frac{8\pi \times 0.125}{(3 \times 10^{10})^3} \cdot \frac{\nu_2^3 - \nu_1^3}{3}
   \]

14.101,"To determine whether AM radio waves can propagate in the tunnel, we need to consider the waveguide properties of the tunnel and the wavelength of the AM radio waves. The tunnel can be approximated as a rectangular waveguide with dimensions 15 m wide and 4 m high. The cutoff frequency for the dominant mode in a rectangular waveguide is given by:

\[
f_c = \frac{c}{2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n}{b}\right)^2}
\]

where:
- \( f_c \) is the cutoff frequency,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)),
- \( a \) is the width of the waveguide (15 m),
- \( b \) is the height of the waveguide (4 m),
- \( m \) and \( n \) are the mode indices.

For the dominant mode, \( \text{TE}_{10} \), we have \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 0 \). Thus, the cutoff frequency is:

\[
f_c = \frac{c}{2a} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2 \times 15} = 10 \, \text{MHz}
\]

AM radio waves have frequencies ranging from 530 kHz to 1600 kHz, which is equivalent to 0.53 MHz to 1.6 MHz. Since these frequencies are below the cutoff frequency of 10 MHz, AM radio waves cannot propagate in the tunnel as they will be attenuated.

Therefore, AM radio waves (530–1600 kHz) cannot propagate in the tunnel."
14.102,"To calculate the least cut-off frequency for \( \text{TE}_{mn} \) waves in a rectangular waveguide with dimensions \( a = 5 \, \text{cm} \) and \( b = 4 \, \text{cm} \), we use the formula for the cut-off frequency \( f_c \):

\[
f_c = \frac{c}{2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n}{b}\right)^2}
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum (\( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)), \( m \) and \( n \) are the mode indices, and \( a \) and \( b \) are the dimensions of the waveguide.

For the least cut-off frequency, we consider the fundamental mode \( \text{TE}_{10} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 0 \). Substituting the values, we have:

\[
f_c = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{0.05}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{0}{0.04}\right)^2}
\]

Simplifying the expression:

\[
f_c = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2} \times \frac{1}{0.05}
\]

\[
f_c = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2 \times 0.05}
\]

\[
f_c = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{0.1}
\]

\[
f_c = 3 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz}

\section*{Rectangular Waveguide Analysis}

Consider a rectangular waveguide with dimensions $x = a$ and $y = b$, where the wave travels along the $z$-direction, the axis of the guide. Given that the $z$-component $H_z$ satisfies the equation:

\begin{equation}
\left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} \right) H_z = \left( k^2 - \omega^2 \mu \varepsilon \right) H_z

\subsection*{(a) Solution for $H_z$}

To solve for $H_z$, we assume a separable solution of the form:

\[
H_z(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)
\]

Substituting into the wave equation, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{X}\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} + \frac{1}{Y}\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2} = k^2 - \omega^2 \mu \varepsilon

This can be separated into two ordinary differential equations:

\[
\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} + k_x^2 X = 0
\]

\[
\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2} + k_y^2 Y = 0
\]

where $k_x^2 + k_y^2 = k^2 - \omega^2 \mu \varepsilon$.

\[
X(x) = A \cos(k_x x) + B \sin(k_x x)
