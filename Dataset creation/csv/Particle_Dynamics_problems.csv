\title{Physics Problem: Spring and Crate Dynamics}
\author{University of Manchester 2007}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}

A spring is used to stop a crate of mass $50\, \text{kg}$ which is sliding on a horizontal surface. The spring has a spring constant $k = 20\, \text{kN/m}$ and is initially in its equilibrium state. In position A, shown in the top diagram, the crate has a velocity of $3.0\, \text{m/s}$. The compression of the spring when the crate is instantaneously at rest (position B in the bottom diagram) is $120\, \text{mm}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] What is the work done by the spring as the crate is brought to a stop?
    \item[(ii)] Write an expression for the work done by friction during the stopping of the crate (in terms of the coefficient of kinetic friction).
    \item[(iii)] Determine the coefficient of friction between the crate and the surface.
    \item[(iv)] What will be the velocity of the crate as it passes again through position A after rebounding off the spring (Fig. 2.14a, b)?
\end{enumerate}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig2_14a.png}
    \caption{Position A and B of the crate with respect to the spring.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution Outline}

\subsection*{(i) Work Done by the Spring}

The work done by the spring, $W_{\text{spring}}$, can be calculated using the formula for the potential energy stored in a compressed spring:

\[
W_{\text{spring}} = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

where $k = 20\, \text{kN/m} = 20000\, \text{N/m}$ and $x = 120\, \text{mm} = 0.12\, \text{m}$.

\subsection*{(ii) Work Done by Friction}

The work done by friction, $W_{\text{friction}}$, can be expressed as:

\[
W_{\text{friction}} = -\mu_k m g d
\]

where $\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction, $m = 50\, \text{kg}$ is the mass of the crate, $g = 9.81\, \text{m/s}^2$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $d$ is the distance over which the friction acts.

\subsection*{(iii) Coefficient of Friction}

To determine the coefficient of friction, $\mu_k$, we use the energy balance equation considering the initial kinetic energy, work done by the spring, and work done by friction.

\subsection*{(iv) Velocity After Rebounding}

The velocity of the crate as it passes again through position A after rebounding off the spring can be found using conservation of energy principles.

Observed in the laboratory frame, a body of mass $m_1$ moving at speed $v$ collides elastically with a stationary mass $m_2$. After the collision, the bodies move at angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ relative to the original direction of motion of $m_1$. Find the velocity of the centre of mass (CM) frame of $m_1$ and $m_2$. Hence show that before the collision in the CM frame $m_1$ and $m_2$ are approaching each other, $m_1$ with speed $\frac{m_2 v}{m_1 + m_2}$ and $m_2$ with speed $\frac{m_1 v}{m_1 + m_2}$. In the CM frame after the collision $m_1$ moves off with speed $\frac{m_2 v}{m_1 + m_2}$ at an angle $\theta$ to its original direction. Draw a diagram showing the direction and speed of $m_2$ in the CM frame after the collision.

\begin{document}

\section*{Elastic Collision Between a Light and a Heavy Body}

Consider an elastic collision between a very light body (mass $m$) and a heavy body (mass $M$), where $m \ll M$. Let the initial velocity of the light body be $u_m$ and the initial velocity of the heavy body be $u_M$. After the collision, let the velocities of the light and heavy bodies be $v_m$ and $v_M$, respectively.

\subsection*{Conservation of Momentum}

The conservation of linear momentum before and after the collision gives us:
\begin{equation}
    m u_m + M u_M = m v_m + M v_M.
    \label{eq:momentum}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Conservation of Kinetic Energy}

The conservation of kinetic energy for an elastic collision is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2} m u_m^2 + \frac{1}{2} M u_M^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 + \frac{1}{2} M v_M^2.
    \label{eq:energy}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Analysis}

To show that the light body proceeds with twice the initial velocity of the heavy body, we need to solve the above equations. Assuming the heavy body is initially at rest ($u_M = 0$), the equations simplify, and we can find the relationship between $v_m$ and $u_M$.

\subsection*{Conclusion}

By solving the simplified equations, it can be shown that:
\begin{equation}
    v_m = 2 u_M.
\end{equation}

This result indicates that after the collision, the light body proceeds with twice the initial velocity of the heavy body.

\begin{document}

In the case of a completely inelastic collision of two bodies with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, traveling with velocities $u_1$ and $u_2$, respectively, we want to show that the energy imparted is proportional to the square of the relative velocity of approach.

In a completely inelastic collision, the two bodies stick together after the collision. The initial kinetic energy of the system is given by:

\begin{equation}
    K_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2
\end{equation}

After the collision, the combined mass $M = m_1 + m_2$ moves with a common velocity $v$. By conservation of momentum, we have:

\begin{equation}
    m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v
\end{equation}

The final kinetic energy of the system is:

\begin{equation}
    K_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v^2
\end{equation}

The energy imparted (or the loss in kinetic energy) during the collision is:

\end{equation}

Substituting for $v$ from the conservation of momentum equation, we can express $\Delta K$ in terms of the relative velocity of approach, $u_1 - u_2$. The energy imparted is proportional to $(u_1 - u_2)^2$.

A flexible rope of length $L$ and mass per unit length $\mu$ slides over the edge of a frictionless table. Initially, let a length $y_0$ of it be hanging at rest over the edge. At time $t$, let a length $y$ be moving with a velocity $\frac{dy}{dt}$ over the edge. Obtain the equation of motion and discuss its solution.

An open railway car of mass \( W \) is running on smooth horizontal rails under rain falling vertically down which it catches and retains in the car. If \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity of the car and \( k \) the mass of rain falling into the car per unit time, show that the distance travelled in time \( t \) is given by:

\[
\frac{Wv_0}{k} \ln\left(1 + \frac{kt}{W}\right).

A uniform chain of length $L$ and mass $M$ hangs vertically above a horizontal table, with its lower end just touching the table. When it falls freely, show that the pressure on the table at any instant during the fall is three times the weight of the portion on the table.
