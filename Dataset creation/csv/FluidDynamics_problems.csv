9.2,"To verify if the continuity equation for steady incompressible flow is satisfied, we need to check if the divergence of the velocity field is zero. The continuity equation for incompressible flow is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z} = 0
\]

Given the velocity components:
- \( v_x = 3x^2 - xy + 2z^2 \)
- \( v_y = 2x^2 - 6xy + y^2 \)
- \( v_z = -2xy - yz + 2y^2 \)

We compute each partial derivative:

1. Compute \(\frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x}\):

\[
\frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(3x^2 - xy + 2z^2) = 6x - y
\]

2. Compute \(\frac{\partial v_y}{\partial y}\):

\[
\frac{\partial v_y}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(2x^2 - 6xy + y^2) = -6x + 2y
\]

3. Compute \(\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}\):

\[
\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(-2xy - yz + 2y^2) = -y
\]

Now, sum these partial derivatives to check if the continuity equation is satisfied:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = (6x - y) + (-6x + 2y) + (-y) = 6x - y - 6x + 2y - y = 0

Thus, the continuity equation is satisfied for the given velocity components, as the divergence of the velocity field is zero:

\section*{Problem}

A venturi meter has a pipe diameter of 20 cm and a throat diameter of 10 cm. If the water pressure in the pipe is 60,000 Pa and in the throat is 45,000 Pa, calculate the rate of flow of water in m\textsuperscript{3}/s.

\section*{Solution}

To find the rate of flow, we use Bernoulli's equation and the continuity equation.

\subsection*{Bernoulli's Equation}

Bernoulli's equation for incompressible flow is given by:

\[
P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2
\]

where:
\begin{align*}
P_1 &= 60,000 \, \text{Pa} \quad \text{(pressure in the pipe)} \\
P_2 &= 45,000 \, \text{Pa} \quad \text{(pressure in the throat)} \\
\rho &= 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \quad \text{(density of water)} \\
v_1 &= \text{velocity in the pipe} \\
v_2 &= \text{velocity in the throat}
\end{align*}

Rearranging Bernoulli's equation to solve for \(v_2\):

\[
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2(P_1 - P_2)}{\rho} + v_1^2}
\]

\subsection*{Continuity Equation}

The continuity equation is given by:

\[
A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2
\]

where:
\begin{align*}
A_1 &= \pi \left(\frac{0.2}{2}\right)^2 = 0.0314 \, \text{m}^2 \quad \text{(cross-sectional area of the pipe)} \\
A_2 &= \pi \left(\frac{0.1}{2}\right)^2 = 0.00785 \, \text{m}^2 \quad \text{(cross-sectional area of the throat)}
\end{align*}

Substituting \(v_2\) from the continuity equation into Bernoulli's equation:

\[
v_1 = \frac{A_2}{A_1} v_2
\]

Substitute \(v_1\) in the Bernoulli's equation:

\[
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2(P_1 - P_2)}{\rho + \left(\frac{A_2}{A_1}\right)^2}}
\]

Calculate \(v_2\):

\[
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2(60,000 - 45,000)}{1000 + \left(\frac{0.00785}{0.0314}\right)^2}}
\]

Finally, calculate the flow rate \(Q\):

\[
Q = A_2 v_2
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
Q = 0.00785 \times v_2
\]

This will give the rate of flow in m\textsuperscript{3}/s.

9.5,"To solve this problem, we need to use Bernoulli's equation and the concept of a Pitot tube. The Pitot tube measures the dynamic pressure, which can be used to find the speed of the aircraft relative to the air. Here's the LaTeX code to format the problem and solution:

```latex
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\section*{Problem}

A Pitot tube, which is used to determine the speed of an aircraft relative to air, is mounted on the wing of a plane. The tube contains alcohol of density \( \rho_{\text{alcohol}} = 810 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) and registers a level difference of \( h = 15.0 \, \text{cm} \). Assuming that the density of air at NTP is \( \rho_{\text{air}} = 1.293 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), find the plane's speed in km/hr relative to the air.

\section*{Solution}

The Pitot tube measures the dynamic pressure, which can be expressed as:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{1}{2} \rho_{\text{air}} v^2
\]

where \( v \) is the speed of the aircraft relative to the air. The pressure difference due to the height difference in the liquid column is given by:

\[
\Delta P = \rho_{\text{alcohol}} g h
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( \Delta P \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \rho_{\text{air}} v^2 = \rho_{\text{alcohol}} g h
\]

Solving for \( v \), we get:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \rho_{\text{alcohol}} g h}{\rho_{\text{air}}}}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\begin{align*}
\rho_{\text{alcohol}} &= 810 \, \text{kg/m}^3, \\
g &= 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2, \\
h &= 0.15 \, \text{m}, \\
\rho_{\text{air}} &= 1.293 \, \text{kg/m}^3.
\end{align*}

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 810 \times 9.81 \times 0.15}{1.293}}
\]

Calculate \( v \):

\[
v \approx \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 810 \times 9.81 \times 0.15}{1.293}} \approx \sqrt{1845.87} \approx 42.96 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Convert \( v \) to km/hr:

\[
v \approx 42.96 \times \frac{3600}{1000} \approx 154.66 \, \text{km/hr}
\]

Thus, the plane's speed relative to the air is approximately \( 154.66 \, \text{km/hr} \).

\section*{Problem}

A garden sprinkler has 80 small holes, each with an area of \(2.5 \, \text{mm}^2\). If water is supplied at the rate of \(2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}\), find the average velocity of the spray.

\section*{Solution}

To find the average velocity of the spray, we can use the equation of continuity, which states that the flow rate \(Q\) is equal to the product of the cross-sectional area \(A\) and the velocity \(v\):

\[
Q = A \cdot v
\]

Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total number of holes, \(n = 80\)
    \item Area of each hole, \(A_{\text{hole}} = 2.5 \, \text{mm}^2 = 2.5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2\)
    \item Total flow rate, \(Q = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}\)
\end{itemize}

The total area \(A\) of all the holes combined is:

\[
A = n \times A_{\text{hole}} = 80 \times 2.5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2 = 2.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Substituting the values into the equation of continuity:

\[
2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s} = 2.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2 \cdot v
\]

Solving for \(v\):

\[
v = \frac{2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}}{2.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2} = 10 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the average velocity of the spray is \(10 \, \text{m/s}\).

where:
- \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) are the pressures on the lower and upper surfaces of the wing, respectively.
- \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) are the speeds of the airflow on the lower and upper surfaces, respectively.
- \( \rho \) is the density of the air.

- \( \Delta P = P_1 - P_2 = 1000 \, \text{Pa} \)
- \( \rho = 1.293 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)

We need to find \( v_2 \).

First, rearrange Bernoulli's equation to solve for \( v_2 \):

\[
P_1 - P_2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2 - \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2
\]

Substitute \( \Delta P \) for \( P_1 - P_2 \):

\[
\Delta P = \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2 - \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2
\]

\[
1000 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1.293 \times v_2^2 - \frac{1}{2} \times 1.293 \times 100^2
\]

Simplify and solve for \( v_2^2 \):

\[
1000 = 0.6465 \times v_2^2 - 6465
\]

\[
1000 + 6465 = 0.6465 \times v_2^2
\]

\[
7465 = 0.6465 \times v_2^2
\]

\[
v_2^2 = \frac{7465}{0.6465}
\]

\[
v_2^2 \approx 11546.42
\]

\[
v_2 \approx \sqrt{11546.42}
\]

\[
v_2 \approx 107.46 \, \text{m/s}

Thus, the speed of flow over the upper surface of the wing should be approximately \( 107.46 \, \text{m/s} \) to achieve a pressure difference of \( 1000 \, \text{Pa} \)."

\section*{Problem}

A venturi meter has a pipe diameter of 4 cm and a throat diameter of 2 cm. The velocity of water in the pipe section is 10 cm/s. Find (a) the pressure drop; (b) the velocity in the throat.

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we will use the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the Bernoulli's equation and the continuity equation.

\subsection*{(a) Pressure Drop}

According to Bernoulli's equation, the pressure drop $\Delta P$ between the pipe section and the throat can be expressed as:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{\rho}{2} \left( v_1^2 - v_2^2 \right)
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\rho$ is the density of water,
    \item $v_1$ is the velocity in the pipe section,
    \item $v_2$ is the velocity in the throat.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{(b) Velocity in the Throat}

Using the continuity equation, we have:

\[
A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A_1 = \pi \left( \frac{D_1}{2} \right)^2$ is the cross-sectional area of the pipe,
    \item $A_2 = \pi \left( \frac{D_2}{2} \right)^2$ is the cross-sectional area of the throat,
    \item $D_1 = 4 \, \text{cm}$ is the diameter of the pipe,
    \item $D_2 = 2 \, \text{cm}$ is the diameter of the throat.
\end{itemize}

Substituting the known values:

\[
\pi \left( \frac{4}{2} \right)^2 \times 10 = \pi \left( \frac{2}{2} \right)^2 \times v_2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
16 \times 10 = 4 \times v_2
\]

\[
v_2 = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \, \text{cm/s}
\]

Thus, the velocity in the throat is \(40 \, \text{cm/s}\).

\section*{Problem Statement}

An apparatus is mounted along the axis of a gas pipeline of cross-sectional area \( A \). Calculate the rate of flow of the gas across the section of the pipe if \( h \) is the difference in the liquid column and \( \rho_L \) and \( \rho_g \) are the densities of the liquid and the gas, respectively. Refer to Fig. 9.3.

    \label{fig:9_3}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

The rate of flow of the gas can be determined using the Bernoulli's equation and the principle of conservation of mass. The pressure difference due to the height difference \( h \) in the liquid column is given by:

\[
\Delta P = \rho_L g h
\]

where \( \rho_L \) is the density of the liquid and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

Assuming the flow is steady and incompressible, the rate of flow \( Q \) can be expressed as:

\[
Q = A v
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the gas. From Bernoulli's equation, the velocity \( v \) can be related to the pressure difference as:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta P}{\rho_g}}
\]

Substituting the expression for \( \Delta P \), we have:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \rho_L g h}{\rho_g}}
\]

Thus, the rate of flow \( Q \) is:

\[
Q = A \sqrt{\frac{2 \rho_L g h}{\rho_g}}
\]

This equation provides the rate of flow of the gas across the section of the pipe.

There is a small hole of cross-sectional area \( s \) at the other end of the cylinder, with \( s \) being much smaller than the cross-sectional area of the piston (see Fig. 9.5). Show that the work to be done by a constant force acting on the piston to squeeze all water from the cylinder in time \( t \) is given by

    \caption{Cylinder with piston and small hole.}
    \label{fig:cylinder_piston}
\end{figure}

\section*{Solution}

To derive the expression for the work done, we start by considering the dynamics of the fluid flow through the small hole. Since the cross-sectional area \( s \) is much smaller than that of the piston, we can assume that the velocity of the water \( v \) through the hole can be described by the equation of continuity and Bernoulli's principle. 

Using the equation of continuity, we have:

\[
A v_p = s v
\]

where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the piston, \( v_p \) is the velocity of the piston, and \( v \) is the velocity of the water through the hole.

Applying Bernoulli's equation between the piston and the hole, we get:

\[
P + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_p^2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2
\]

Since the pressure \( P \) is constant due to the constant force applied, we can solve for \( v \) in terms of \( v_p \).

The work done \( W \) by the force on the piston is given by the kinetic energy imparted to the water:

\[
W = \int F \, dx = \int \rho A v_p^2 \, dt
\]

Substituting \( v = \frac{V}{st} \) and solving for \( W \), we arrive at:

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\rho V^3}{s^2 t^2}
\]

This completes the derivation.

\[
v = \sqrt{2g h}
\]

where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity and \( h \) is the height of the water column above the hole.

The rate of change of the volume of water in the tank is equal to the rate at which water flows out of the hole:

\[
A \frac{dh}{dt} = -a v
\]

Substituting \( v = \sqrt{2gh} \) into the equation, we get:

\[
A \frac{dh}{dt} = -a \sqrt{2gh}
\]

Rearranging and separating variables, we have:

\[
\frac{A}{a} \frac{dh}{\sqrt{h}} = -\sqrt{2g} \, dt
\]

Integrating both sides from \( h_1 \) to \( h_2 \) and from \( 0 \) to \( t \), respectively, gives:

\[
\int_{h_1}^{h_2} \frac{dh}{\sqrt{h}} = -\frac{a}{A} \sqrt{2g} \int_{0}^{t} dt
\]

The integral on the left side is:

\[

\begin{document}

\section*{Problem}

A large tank is filled with water. The total pressure at the bottom is 3.0 atm. If a small hole is punched at the bottom, what is the velocity of efflux?

\section*{Solution}

To find the velocity of efflux, we can use Torricelli's Law, which is derived from Bernoulli's equation. The velocity \( v \) of efflux from the hole can be given by:

\[
v = \sqrt{2gh}
\]

where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height of the water column above the hole. However, since we are given the pressure, we need to relate it to the height.

The pressure at the bottom of the tank is given as 3.0 atm. We convert this pressure to pascals:

\[
P = 3.0 \, \text{atm} = 3.0 \times 101325 \, \text{Pa} = 303975 \, \text{Pa}
\]

Assuming atmospheric pressure is \( P_0 = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \), the gauge pressure is:

\[
P_{\text{gauge}} = P - P_0 = 303975 \, \text{Pa} - 101325 \, \text{Pa} = 202650 \, \text{Pa}
\]

Using the relation between pressure and height, \( P_{\text{gauge}} = \rho gh \), where \( \rho \) is the density of water (\( \rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)), we can solve for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{P_{\text{gauge}}}{\rho g} = \frac{202650}{1000 \times 9.81} \approx 20.65 \, \text{m}
\]

Now, substituting \( h \) back into Torricelli's equation:

\[
v = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 20.65} \approx \sqrt{405.93} \approx 20.14 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the velocity of efflux is approximately \( 20.14 \, \text{m/s} \).

If $A_1 = 2A_2$ and the volume flux is identical, then what should be the ratio $\frac{h_1}{h_2}$?

where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the hole, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the depth of the liquid above the hole.

Canceling $A_2$ from both sides, we have:

\[
2 \sqrt{h_1} = \sqrt{h_2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain:

\[
4h_1 = h_2
\]

Thus, the ratio $\frac{h_1}{h_2}$ is:

\[
\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \frac{1}{4}

9.23,"To solve this problem, we can use Torricelli's theorem, which relates the efflux velocity of a fluid to the height of the fluid column above the point of exit. The efflux velocity \( v \) can be calculated using the equation:

\[
v = \sqrt{2gh_{\text{eff}}}
\]

where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h_{\text{eff}} \) is the effective height of the fluid column, taking into account the different densities of the fluids involved.

Given:
- Height of water column, \( h_w = 60 \, \text{cm} = 0.6 \, \text{m} \)
- Height of kerosene column, \( h_k = 40 \, \text{cm} = 0.4 \, \text{m} \)
- Specific gravity of water, \( SG_w = 1.0 \)
- Specific gravity of kerosene, \( SG_k = 0.8 \)

The effective height \( h_{\text{eff}} \) is given by:

\[
h_{\text{eff}} = h_w + SG_k \cdot h_k
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
h_{\text{eff}} = 0.6 \, \text{m} + 0.8 \times 0.4 \, \text{m}
\]

\[
h_{\text{eff}} = 0.6 \, \text{m} + 0.32 \, \text{m} = 0.92 \, \text{m}
\]

Now, substituting \( h_{\text{eff}} \) into the equation for \( v \):

\[
v = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 0.92 \, \text{m}}
\]

\[
v = \sqrt{18.072 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2}

\[
v \approx 4.25 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the efflux velocity of the water is approximately \( 4.25 \, \text{m/s} \)."

\section*{Problem Statement}

A vessel filled with water is punctured with two holes on the opposite side, each with a cross-sectional area of \SI{1.0}{\centi\meter\squared}. If the difference in height of the holes is \SI{51}{\centi\meter}, calculate the resultant force of reaction of the water flowing out of the vessel.

\section*{Solution}

To find the resultant force of reaction of the water flowing out, we use Torricelli's theorem, which states that the speed \( v \) of efflux of a fluid under gravity through a hole is given by:

\[
v = \sqrt{2gh}
\]

where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\SI{9.81}{\meter\per\second\squared}) and \( h \) is the height difference.

Given:
\begin{align*}
A &= \SI{1.0}{\centi\meter\squared} = \SI{1.0e-4}{\meter\squared}, \\
\Delta h &= \SI{51}{\centi\meter} = \SI{0.51}{\meter}.
\end{align*}

The velocity of water flowing out from each hole is:
\[
v = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 0.51} = \sqrt{9.999} \approx \SI{3.16}{\meter\per\second}.
\]

The force of reaction \( F \) is given by the rate of change of momentum, which is the product of the mass flow rate and velocity:

\[
F = \rho A v^2
\]

where \( \rho \) is the density of water (\SI{1000}{\kilogram\per\meter\cubed}).

Substituting the values, we get:
\[
F = 1000 \times 1.0 \times 10^{-4} \times (3.16)^2
\]

\[
F = 1000 \times 1.0 \times 10^{-4} \times 9.9856 \approx \SI{0.9986}{\newton}.
\]

Therefore, the resultant force of reaction of the water flowing out of the vessel is approximately \SI{0.9986}{\newton}.

9.25,"To solve this problem, we will use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which describes the pressure drop due to viscosity in a long cylindrical pipe. The equation is given by:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{8 \eta L Q}{\pi r^4}
\]

where:
- \(\Delta P\) is the pressure drop,
- \(\eta\) is the coefficient of viscosity,
- \(L\) is the length of the tube,
- \(Q\) is the volumetric flow rate,
- \(r\) is the radius of the tube.

Given:
- Diameter of the tube, \(d = 8 \, \text{cm} = 0.08 \, \text{m}\),
- Length of the tube, \(L = 4 \, \text{km} = 4000 \, \text{m}\),
- Volumetric flow rate, \(Q = 120 \, \text{l/min} = 120 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3/\text{min} = \frac{120 \times 10^{-3}}{60} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}\),
- Coefficient of viscosity, \(\eta = 0.001 \, \text{Pa} \cdot \text{s}\).

First, calculate the radius of the tube:
\[
r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{0.08}{2} = 0.04 \, \text{m}
\]

Next, convert the flow rate to \(\text{m}^3/\text{s}\):
\[
Q = \frac{120 \times 10^{-3}}{60} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}
\]

Now, substitute the values into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:
\[
\Delta P = \frac{8 \times 0.001 \times 4000 \times 2 \times 10^{-3}}{\pi \times (0.04)^4}
\]

Calculate \(\Delta P\):
\[
\Delta P = \frac{8 \times 0.001 \times 4000 \times 2 \times 10^{-3}}{\pi \times (0.04)^4} = \frac{0.064}{\pi \times 2.56 \times 10^{-7}}
\]

\[
\Delta P \approx \frac{0.064}{8.042 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 7959.6 \, \text{Pa}
\]

Finally, convert the pressure drop to atmospheres:
\[
\Delta P_{\text{atm}} = \frac{7959.6}{1.013 \times 10^5} \approx 0.0785 \, \text{atm}
\]

Thus, the pressure required to maintain the flow is approximately \(7959.6 \, \text{Pa}\) or \(0.0785 \, \text{atm}\)."

\section*{Problem}

Two raindrops fall through air with a terminal velocity of $v_T \, \text{cm/s}$. If the drops coalesce, what will be the new terminal velocity?

\section*{Solution}

When two raindrops coalesce, their combined volume is the sum of their individual volumes. Assuming each raindrop is spherical, the volume $V$ of a raindrop is given by:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

where $r$ is the radius of the raindrop. If two raindrops coalesce, the new volume $V'$ is:

\[
V' = 2V = \frac{8}{3} \pi r^3
\]

Let $r'$ be the radius of the new, larger raindrop. Then:

\[
\frac{4}{3} \pi (r')^3 = \frac{8}{3} \pi r^3
\]

Solving for $r'$, we find:

\[
(r')^3 = 2r^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r' = r \cdot 2^{1/3}
\]

The terminal velocity $v_T$ of a raindrop is proportional to the square root of its radius, assuming the drag force is proportional to the velocity squared. Therefore, the new terminal velocity $v_T'$ is:

\[
v_T' = v_T \cdot \sqrt{2^{1/3}}
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
v_T' = v_T \cdot 2^{1/6}
\]

Thus, the new terminal velocity of the coalesced raindrop is $v_T \cdot 2^{1/6} \, \text{cm/s}$.

\section*{Problem}

A quantity $Q$ cm\textsuperscript{3} of water flows per second through a horizontal tube of uniform bore of radius $r$ and of length $l$. Another tube of half the length but radius $2r$ is connected in parallel to the same pressure head. What will be the total quantity of water flowing per second through these two tubes?

\section*{Solution}

To solve this problem, we use Poiseuille's law for laminar flow, which states that the flow rate $Q$ through a cylindrical tube is given by:

\[
Q = \frac{\pi r^4 \Delta P}{8 \eta l}
\]

where:
- $r$ is the radius of the tube,
- $\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across the tube,
- $\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid,
- $l$ is the length of the tube.

For the first tube with radius $r$ and length $l$, the flow rate is:

\[
Q_1 = \frac{\pi r^4 \Delta P}{8 \eta l}
\]

For the second tube with radius $2r$ and length $\frac{l}{2}$, the flow rate is:

\[
Q_2 = \frac{\pi (2r)^4 \Delta P}{8 \eta \left(\frac{l}{2}\right)} = \frac{\pi \cdot 16r^4 \Delta P}{8 \eta \cdot \frac{l}{2}} = \frac{32 \pi r^4 \Delta P}{8 \eta l} = 4 \cdot \frac{\pi r^4 \Delta P}{8 \eta l}
\]

Thus, the flow rate through the second tube is four times that of the first tube:

\[
Q_2 = 4Q_1
\]

Since the tubes are connected in parallel, the total flow rate $Q_{\text{total}}$ is the sum of the flow rates through each tube:

\[
Q_{\text{total}} = Q_1 + Q_2 = Q_1 + 4Q_1 = 5Q_1
\]

Therefore, the total quantity of water flowing per second through these two tubes is $5Q_1$.
