6.5,"To show that a floating body performs simple harmonic motion when given a small vertical displacement from its equilibrium position, we start by considering the buoyant force acting on the body. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. When the body is displaced vertically by a small distance \( x \), the change in the volume of the displaced liquid is \( A x \), where \( A \) is the area of the plane of floatation.

The change in the buoyant force, which acts as the restoring force, is given by:

\[
F = -\rho g A x
\]

where \( \rho \) is the density of the liquid, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. According to Hooke's Law for simple harmonic motion, the restoring force can be expressed as:

\[
F = -k x
\]

where \( k \) is the effective spring constant. Equating the two expressions for the restoring force, we have:

\[
k = \rho g A
\]

The equation of motion for the floating body is then:

\[
m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\rho g A x
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the body. The mass \( m \) can be related to the volume of the displaced liquid \( V \) by:

\[
m = \rho V
\]

Substituting this into the equation of motion gives:

\[
\rho V \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\rho g A x
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
V \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -g A x
\]

This is the standard form of the differential equation for simple harmonic motion, which has a solution of the form:

\[
x(t) = A \cos\left(\omega t + \phi\right)
\]

where the angular frequency \( \omega \) is given by:

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g A}{V}}
\]

The period \( T \) of the simple harmonic motion is related to the angular frequency by:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{V}{g A}}
\]

Thus, the period of the simple harmonic motion of the floating body is:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{V}{g A}}
\]

This completes the demonstration that a floating body, when given a small vertical displacement from its equilibrium position, performs simple harmonic motion with the period \( 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{V}{g A}} \). Viscous forces are ignored in this analysis."

\begin{document}

\section*{Problem Statement}

Imagine a tunnel bored along the diameter of the Earth, which is assumed to have constant density. A box is thrown into the tunnel (chute). 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Show that the box executes Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) inside the tunnel about the center of the Earth.
    \item[(b)] Find the time period of oscillations.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Simple Harmonic Motion}

To show that the box executes SHM, we start by considering the gravitational force acting on the box. Assuming a constant density $\rho$, the gravitational force inside the Earth at a distance $r$ from the center is given by:

\[
F = -\frac{G M(r)}{r^2} \cdot m
\]

where $M(r)$ is the mass enclosed within radius $r$, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $m$ is the mass of the box. Since the Earth has constant density, $M(r)$ is proportional to $r^3$:

\[
M(r) = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

Substituting $M(r)$ into the force equation, we have:

\[
F = -\frac{G \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{r^2} \cdot m = -\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho m r
\]

This force is proportional to $-r$, indicating that the motion is simple harmonic. The angular frequency $\omega$ is given by:

\[
\omega^2 = \frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho
\]

\subsection*{(b) Time Period of Oscillations}

The time period $T$ of the oscillations is related to the angular frequency by:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
\]

Substituting the expression for $\omega$, we find:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{3}{4 \pi G \rho}}
\]

Thus, the time period of oscillations is:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{3}{4 \pi G \rho}}
\]

\section*{Problem Statement}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] At what distance from the equilibrium position is the kinetic energy equal to the potential energy for a simple harmonic motion (SHM)?
    
    \item[(b)] In SHM, if the displacement is one-half of the amplitude, show that the kinetic energy and potential energy are in the ratio 3:1.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{(a) Equal Kinetic and Potential Energy}

For a simple harmonic oscillator, the total energy \( E \) is given by:
\[
E = K + U
\]
where \( K \) is the kinetic energy and \( U \) is the potential energy.

The kinetic energy \( K \) is given by:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

The potential energy \( U \) is given by:
\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

At the point where \( K = U \), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

\subsection*{(b) Ratio of Kinetic and Potential Energy}

Given that the displacement \( x \) is one-half of the amplitude \( A \), i.e., \( x = \frac{A}{2} \).

The potential energy at this displacement is:
\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k \left(\frac{A}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{8} k A^2
\]

The total energy \( E \) is:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2
\]

The kinetic energy \( K \) is:
\[
K = E - U = \frac{1}{2} k A^2 - \frac{1}{8} k A^2 = \frac{3}{8} k A^2
\]

Thus, the ratio of kinetic energy to potential energy is:
\[
\frac{K}{U} = \frac{\frac{3}{8} k A^2}{\frac{1}{8} k A^2} = 3
\]

Therefore, the ratio of kinetic energy to potential energy is \( 3:1 \).

\begin{document}

Consider a simple pendulum with a bob of mass \( m \) and string length \( L \). The tension \( T \) in the string at the lowest position is given to be 1\% higher than the weight of the bob. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[
T = mg + 0.01 \cdot mg = 1.01 \, mg
\]

At the lowest position, the tension in the string is also given by the centripetal force required for the circular motion of the pendulum bob, which can be expressed as:

\[
T = mg + \frac{mv^2}{L}
\]

Equating the two expressions for tension, we have:

\[
1.01 \, mg = mg + \frac{mv^2}{L}
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
0.01 \, mg = \frac{mv^2}{L}
\]

Solving for \( v^2 \), we get:

\[
v^2 = 0.01 \, gL
\]

The maximum speed \( v \) occurs at the lowest point, and it is related to the angular amplitude \( \theta_0 \) by the energy conservation principle. The potential energy at the maximum height is equal to the kinetic energy at the lowest point:

\[
\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = mgL (1 - \cos \theta_0)
\]

Substituting \( v^2 = 0.01 \, gL \) into the energy equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2} m (0.01 \, gL) = mgL (1 - \cos \theta_0)
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
0.005 \, mgL = mgL (1 - \cos \theta_0)
\]

Dividing both sides by \( mgL \), we get:

\[
0.005 = 1 - \cos \theta_0
\]

Solving for \( \cos \theta_0 \), we find:

\[
\cos \theta_0 = 0.995
\]

For small angles, we can use the approximation \( \cos \theta_0 \approx 1 - \frac{\theta_0^2}{2} \). Thus:

\[
1 - \frac{\theta_0^2}{2} \approx 0.995
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\theta_0^2}{2} \approx 0.005
\]

Solving for \( \theta_0^2 \), we get:

\[
\theta_0^2 \approx 0.01
\]

Taking the square root, we find:

\[
\theta_0 \approx 0.1 \, \text{rad}
\]

Thus, the angular amplitude of the pendulum is approximately \( 0.1 \, \text{rad} \).
