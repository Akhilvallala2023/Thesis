Identify the Forces Acting on the Proton:**\\n\\n- **Electric Force (\\\\( F_e \\\\)):** The electric force acting on a charged particle is given by the formula:\\n  \\\\[\\n  F_e = qE\\n  \\\\]\\n  where \\\\( q \\\\) is the charge of the proton, and \\\\( E \\\\) is the electric field strength.\\n\\n- **Magnetic Force (\\\\( F_m \\\\)):** The magnetic force on a moving charge is given by the formula:\\n  \\\\[\\n  F_m = qvB \\\\sin \\\\theta\\n  \\\\]\\n  where \\\\( v \\\\) is the velocity of the proton, \\\\( B \\\\) is the magnetic field strength, and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field.

Conditions for Zero Net Force:**\\n\\nFor the net force on the proton to be zero, the magnetic force and the electric force must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction:\\n\\\\[\\nF_m = F_e\\n\\\\]\\n\\n**3. Substitute the Expressions for Forces:**\\n\\nSubstituting the expressions for \\\\( F_m \\\\) and \\\\( F_e \\\\), we have:\\n\\\\[\\nqvB = qE\\n\\\\]\\n\\n**4. Cancel Out Common Factors:**\\n\\nSince the charge \\\\( q \\\\) is common on both sides of the equation, it can be canceled out (assuming \\\\( q \\\\neq 0 \\\\)):\\n\\\\[\\nvB = E\\n\\\\]\\n\\n**5.
